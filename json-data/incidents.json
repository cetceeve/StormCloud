Apigee integrated developer portal customers experienced elevated 5xx responses, issues authenticating to API, and issues updating portals when accessing it via Apigee Edge or Apigee X for a duration of 8 hours and 25 minutes.\nTo our Apigee customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue was an incorrect configuration change made to one of the Apigee load balancers for developer portals. This configuration change caused all the requests that were routed through the affected Apigee load balancer to fail with a default 404 error code.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted by a support case on Monday, 11 September at 07:00 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. They were able to identify a misconfiguration in one of the load balancers, which was caused by a change aimed at improving the load balancer’s performance. Upon identifying the misconfiguration, Google Engineers quickly regenerated the configurations of the affected Apigee load balancer and ensured that both load balancers were properly configured.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking the following steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- Identify the cause of the inconsistent configurations for the developer portal load balancers\n- Improve the change management process for Apigee load balancer changes to prevent similar issues\n- Improve monitoring and visibility to ensure the incorrect configurations are identified proactively\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 11 September from 04:00 to 12:25 US/Pacific, users experienced elevated error rates with errors like \"Failed to load users\", \"Failed to load zone\" or \"Service Unavailable”, when interacting with the developer portal. Customers also experienced issues authenticating to API portals or updating their portals.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong (asia-east2)","id":"asia-east2"},{"title":"Tokyo (asia-northeast1)","id":"asia-northeast1"},{"title":"Osaka (asia-northeast2)","id":"asia-northeast2"},{"title":"Seoul (asia-northeast3)","id":"asia-northeast3"},{"title":"Mumbai (asia-south1)","id":"asia-south1"},{"title":"Delhi (asia-south2)","id":"asia-south2"},{"title":"Singapore (asia-southeast1)","id":"asia-southeast1"},{"title":"Jakarta (asia-southeast2)","id":"asia-southeast2"},{"title":"Sydney (australia-southeast1)","id":"australia-southeast1"},{"title":"Melbourne (australia-southeast2)","id":"australia-southeast2"},{"title":"Warsaw (europe-central2)","id":"europe-central2"},{"title":"Finland (europe-north1)","id":"europe-north1"},{"title":"Madrid (europe-southwest1)","id":"europe-southwest1"},{"title":"Belgium (europe-west1)","id":"europe-west1"},{"title":"London (europe-west2)","id":"europe-west2"},{"title":"Frankfurt (europe-west3)","id":"europe-west3"},{"title":"Netherlands (europe-west4)","id":"europe-west4"},{"title":"Zurich (europe-west6)","id":"europe-west6"},{"title":"Milan (europe-west8)","id":"europe-west8"},{"title":"Paris (europe-west9)","id":"europe-west9"},{"title":"Tel Aviv (me-west1)","id":"me-west1"},{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"},{"title":"Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)","id":"northamerica-northeast2"},{"title":"São Paulo (southamerica-east1)","id":"southamerica-east1"},{"title":"Santiago (southamerica-west1)","id":"southamerica-west1"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"},{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Northern Virginia (us-east4)","id":"us-east4"},{"title":"Columbus (us-east5)","id":"us-east5"},{"title":"Dallas (us-south1)","id":"us-south1"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"},{"title":"Los Angeles (us-west2)","id":"us-west2"},{"title":"Salt Lake City (us-west3)","id":"us-west3"},{"title":"Las Vegas (us-west4)","id":"us-west4"}]},{"created":"2023-09-11T22:31:49+00:00","modified":"2023-09-11T22:31:49+00:00","when":"2023-09-11T22:31:49+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

Summary\nOn Monday, 11 September 2023, Apigee integrated developer portal customers experienced elevated 5xx responses, issues authenticating to API, and issues updating portals when accessing it via Apigee Edge or Apigee X for a duration of 8 hours and 25 minutes.\nTo our Apigee customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue was an incorrect configuration change made to one of the Apigee load balancers for developer portals. This configuration change caused all the requests that were routed through the affected Apigee load balancer to fail with a default 404 error code.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted by a support case on Monday, 11 September at 07:00 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. They were able to identify a misconfiguration in one of the load balancers, which was caused by a change aimed at improving the load balancer’s performance. Upon identifying the misconfiguration, Google Engineers quickly regenerated the configurations of the affected Apigee load balancer and ensured that both load balancers were properly configured.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking the following steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- Identify the cause of the inconsistent configurations for the developer portal load balancers\n- Improve the change management process for Apigee load balancer changes to prevent similar issues\n- Improve monitoring and visibility to ensure the incorrect configurations are identified proactively\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 11 September from 04:00 to 12:25 US/Pacific, users experienced elevated error rates with errors like \"Failed to load users\", \"Failed to load zone\" or \"Service Unavailable”, when interacting with the developer portal. Customers also experienced issues authenticating to API portals or updating their portals.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong

Customers in the impacted location experienced availability issues and were unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections for a period of 19 hours and 11 minutes. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe outage occurred due to a fire in an underground, third-party owned cable chamber that affected a larger leased fiber cable below street level, impacting the availability of the only physical path to the Edge Availability Domains (EADs) [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table). The fire affected a fiber conduit that is leveraged by Google to provide inter-zone connectivity.\nAt the time of the fire, this was the only physical path providing interconnect to customers from these EADs. This is not the expected redundancy.\nThe Edge Availability Domains, [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), are planned and built for full redundancy of fiber connections back to the Google backbone network, with no single points of failure in equipment, and fiber paths are verified to be physically diverse along the whole route between Google network locations.\nThe EADs were operating without a usable redundant path due to previous fiber cuts that remained unrepaired. The repairs were not completed due to prematurely updated documentation in our systems to reflect our plans for future migrations, which caused us to believe the inactive fiber status was intentional.\nOther than the impact to Cloud Interconnect, the northamerica-northeast1 (YUL) region was unaffected.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via our internal systems on 14 August, 16:11 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineering teams worked with the third-party fiber vendor and restored service for Cloud Interconnect location [yul-zone1-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), on Tuesday, 15 August 2023 at 01:06 US/Pacific. Service for [yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), was restored on Tuesday, 15 August at 11:22 US/Pacific.\nThe fire-damaged fiber could not be repaired in place, so the damaged underground cable chamber had to be bypassed physically. This required splicing several hundred fiber links, including the ones leased by Google, which extended the repair timeline.\nSimultaneously, Google attempted to return to service the redundant physical path not affected by the fire. However, this was not immediately successful, and the incident was resolved by the repair of the primary path.\nGoogle restored full redundancy for both EADs (both primary and redundant paths) on 16 August, at 14:55 US/Pacific.\nGoogle Cloud Interconnect offers a 99.99% reliability SLA, for customers who deploy at least two connections in each of two interconnect regions. Customers that had deployed this architecture were not affected by this outage. For more information on this feature, see the following: [Topology for production-level applications overview](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/tutorials/production-level-overview)\nAdditionally, Google is committed to preventing future recurrence by taking the following actions:\n- Improve rules within Google's internal repair prioritization system so that any issue that results in a loss of redundancy for more than one EAD in a region is treated at the highest repair priority, where Google's target is a 24 hour return to service.\n- Ensure that exceptions that occur between the migration and repair process for fibers have a documented escalation process, and that migration processes do not change fiber documentation until immediately after the migration is complete.\n- Complete the migration (both in Montreal and elsewhere) that moves all Interconnect zones to fully active-active connections. This builds upon our existing standard of \"no single failure can affect both EADs in a region\" to a stronger commitment of \"no single failure can affect any EAD\".\n- Ensure that clear notifications for isolation outages are sent proactively to customers.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* Starting on 14 August, 16:11 US/Pacific, 100% of customers using Cloud Interconnect in Montreal, Canada experienced unavailability, with customers unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections in that location.\n* The interconnect location “yul-zone1-1944” was restored 10 hours, 16 minutes before yul-zone2-1944, allowing customers with redundant connectivity to access services via yul-zone1-1944 until yul-zone2-1944 was restored.\n* Other Google Cloud services in northamerica-northeast1 were accessible from interconnects outside of Montreal, Canada.\n---------------","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"}]},{"created":"2023-08-17T15:36:36+00:00","modified":"2023-08-17T15:47:16+00:00","when":"2023-08-17T15:36:36+00:00","text":"Google restored full redundancy for both Edge Availability Domains (both primary and redundant paths) on 16 August, at 14:55 US/Pacific\nWe will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide additional details.\n--------------------","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"}]},{"created":"2023-08-15T22:42:48+00:00","modified":"2023-08-16T06:14:48+00:00","when":"2023-08-15T22:42:48+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service outage may have caused.

The customer impact during the outage was due to two unrelated issues:\nThe [Edge Availability Domains](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/terminology#edge-availability-domain) - [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table) were operating without a usable redundant path due to a previous fiber cut that remained unrepaired. The repairs were not completed due to prematurely updating the documentation in our systems to reflect our plans for future migrations.\nThe outage occurred when a fire broke out in an underground third-party owned cable chamber, which affected a large leased fiber cable below street level, impacting the availability of the only remaining physical path to these Edge Availability Domains. The fire-affected large fiber cable is leveraged by Google to provide inter-zone connectivity. At the time of the fire this was the only physical path between the affected routers providing interconnect to customers.\nGoogle engineering teams worked with the third party fiber vendor and restored service for Cloud Interconnect location [yul-zone1-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table) on Tuesday, 2023-08-15 at 01:06 US/Pacific and restored service for [yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table) on Tuesday, 2023-08-15 at 11:22 US/Pacific.\nThe fire-damaged fiber could not be repaired in place, so the damaged underground cable chamber had to be bypassed physically. This required splicing over a few hundred fiber links, including the ones leased by Google, which extended the repair timeline.\nSimultaneously, Google attempted to return to service the redundant physical path not affected by the fire, however, this was not immediately successful before splicing efforts completed, resolving the outage. Google is continuing to work with third party vendors to establish all redundant physical paths.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide additional details.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Customers using Cloud Interconnect in Montreal, Canada could have experienced availability issues, with customers unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections in that location.

Customers in the impacted location experienced availability issues and were unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections for a period of 19 hours and 11 minutes. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe outage occurred due to a fire in an underground, third-party owned cable chamber that affected a larger leased fiber cable below street level, impacting the availability of the only physical path to the Edge Availability Domains (EADs) [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table). The fire affected a fiber conduit that is leveraged by Google to provide inter-zone connectivity.\nAt the time of the fire, this was the only physical path providing interconnect to customers from these EADs. This is not the expected redundancy.\nThe Edge Availability Domains, [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), are planned and built for full redundancy of fiber connections back to the Google backbone network, with no single points of failure in equipment, and fiber paths are verified to be physically diverse along the whole route between Google network locations.\nThe EADs were operating without a usable redundant path due to previous fiber cuts that remained unrepaired. The repairs were not completed due to prematurely updated documentation in our systems to reflect our plans for future migrations, which caused us to believe the inactive fiber status was intentional.\nOther than the impact to Cloud Interconnect, the northamerica-northeast1 (YUL) region was unaffected.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via our internal systems on 14 August, 16:11 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineering teams worked with the third-party fiber vendor and restored service for Cloud Interconnect location [yul-zone1-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), on Tuesday, 15 August 2023 at 01:06 US/Pacific. Service for [yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), was restored on Tuesday, 15 August at 11:22 US/Pacific.\nThe fire-damaged fiber could not be repaired in place, so the damaged underground cable chamber had to be bypassed physically. This required splicing several hundred fiber links, including the ones leased by Google, which extended the repair timeline.\nSimultaneously, Google attempted to return to service the redundant physical path not affected by the fire. However, this was not immediately successful, and the incident was resolved by the repair of the primary path.\nGoogle restored full redundancy for both EADs (both primary and redundant paths) on 16 August, at 14:55 US/Pacific.\nGoogle Cloud Interconnect offers a 99.99% reliability SLA, for customers who deploy at least two connections in each of two interconnect regions. Customers that had deployed this architecture were not affected by this outage. For more information on this feature, see the following: [Topology for production-level applications overview](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/tutorials/production-level-overview)\nAdditionally, Google is committed to preventing future recurrence by taking the following actions:\n- Improve rules within Google's internal repair prioritization system so that any issue that results in a loss of redundancy for more than one EAD in a region is treated at the highest repair priority, where Google's target is a 24 hour return to service.\n- Ensure that exceptions that occur between the migration and repair process for fibers have a documented escalation process, and that migration processes do not change fiber documentation until immediately after the migration is complete.\n- Complete the migration (both in Montreal and elsewhere) that moves all Interconnect zones to fully active-active connections. This builds upon our existing standard of \"no single failure can affect both EADs in a region\" to a stronger commitment of \"no single failure can affect any EAD\".\n- Ensure that clear notifications for isolation outages are sent proactively to customers.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* Starting on 14 August, 16:11 US/Pacific, 100% of customers using Cloud Interconnect in Montreal, Canada experienced unavailability, with customers unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections in that location.\n* The interconnect location “yul-zone1-1944” was restored 10 hours, 16 minutes before yul-zone2-1944, allowing customers with redundant connectivity to access services via yul-zone1-1944 until yul-zone2-1944 was restored.\n* Other Google Cloud services in northamerica-northeast1 were accessible from interconnects outside of Montreal, Canada.\n---------------","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"}]},"status_impact":"SERVICE_OUTAGE","severity":"high","service_key":"5x6CGnZvSHQZ26KtxpK1","service_name":"Hybrid Connectivity","affected_products":[{"title":"Hybrid Connectivity","id":"5x6CGnZvSHQZ26KtxpK1"}],"uri":"incidents/ZQFpiLgvHB7a7Ua7o26T","currently_affected_locations":[],"previously_affected_locations":[{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"}]},{"id":"1mJnJrkjLxicpPtF455R","number":"10515541142767626282","begin":"2023-08-11T23:30:00+00:00","created":"2023-08-12T00:35:23+00:00","end":"2023-08-12T05:27:00+00:00","modified":"2023-08-14T17:21:44+00:00","external_desc":"Media CDN increased rates of 5xx errors","updates":[{"created":"2023-08-14T17:21:33+00:00","modified":"2023-08-14T17:21:33+00:00","when":"2023-08-14T17:21:33+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

High error rates were seen for CreateConversation, CreateParticipant, and (Streaming)AnalyzeContent functionalities. Any customer applications or services dependent on Dialogflow “global-dialogflow.googleapis.com” or “dialogflow.googleapis.com” would have experienced service interruptions. Only [“Global” location](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail\n) was affected by the issue and no other locations were affected.\nTo our Dialogflow customers whose applications were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is exhaustion of thread and memory resources in the component that handles incoming and outgoing API requests. The exhaustion was triggered by recent code changes to improve the efficiency of interactions between Dialogflow API, Pub/Sub messaging, and internal authentication services, and by the unexpected behavior of some incoming queries.\nOne of our largest customers began trying out a new, private feature in Dialogflow. Their client behaved in an unexpected way, exposing a potential resource exhaustion involving Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions, which we use to keep conversation state synchronized between multiple platforms. To create conversations using Dialogflow, topic subscriptions are initialized. Once conversations are completed, these subscriptions are cleared. As a result of the recent code change, customer projects that initiated conversations without completing them started to accumulate topic subscriptions, leading to a backlog.\nThe resource exhaustion only became apparent after we received a large volume of traffic that exhibited this unusual behavior on 28 July 2023. This manifested in our servers as spiking memory usage and thread exhaustion. When the pool of available threads began to dwindle, the incident started impacting other customers as well.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by an internal monitoring system on 28 July 2023 at 10:36 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. From the initial analysis, Google engineers found that the majority of errors were from one data center. At 11:25 US/Pacific, a mitigation was attempted by directing the traffic away from that data center. This attempt did not resolve the errors, instead the issue moved to another data center. After further investigation, the engineering team identified that many threads were waiting for specific event completion. Google engineers temporarily disabled those events at 13:10 US/Pacific. This showed signs of improvement in error rate and latency. However, around 30 minutes later, the issue re-appeared.\nGoogle engineers continued the investigation and identified a rollout from 17 July 2023 to be contributing to the issue and initiated a rollback at 14:20 US/Pacific. At 15:25 US/Pacific, the engineering team started noticing an improvement in error rate, and the customer impact was completely mitigated at 15:52 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Implement a fix to thread resource exhaustion triggered by queries that do not complete the conversation properly.\n* Implement safeguards to gradually roll out changes to limit the scope of impact.\n* Implement monitoring for queries that do not exit properly upon completion of conversations.\n* Improve traffic isolation by implementing separate resource pools for different types of API requests.\n* Improve traffic handling in the component that handles the API requests by implementing a safety mechanism that allows for graceful handling of overload conditions.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, 28 July 2023 from 10:17 to 15:52 US/Pacific, requests to Dialogflow CX and Dialogflow ES experienced elevated DEADLINE_EXCEEDED errors and latency issues. - Around 9% of overall traffic to “global-dialogflow.googleapis.com” or “dialogflow.googleapis.com” was experiencing elevated error rates and latency. - Based on analysis from the previous day requests, we estimate that around 25% of expected traffic to [“Global” location](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail\n) was served UNAVAILABLE errors.\nDepending on the workload and query distribution, some customers may have noticed higher error rates than the rates provided above.\n-------------------------","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Tokyo (asia-northeast1)","id":"asia-northeast1"},{"title":"Mumbai (asia-south1)","id":"asia-south1"},{"title":"Singapore (asia-southeast1)","id":"asia-southeast1"},{"title":"Sydney (australia-southeast1)","id":"australia-southeast1"},{"title":"Belgium (europe-west1)","id":"europe-west1"},{"title":"London (europe-west2)","id":"europe-west2"},{"title":"Frankfurt (europe-west3)","id":"europe-west3"},{"title":"Global","id":"global"},{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"},{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"}]},{"created":"2023-07-31T16:39:56+00:00","modified":"2023-07-31T16:44:23+00:00","when":"2023-07-31T16:39:56+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

Summary\nOn Friday, 28 July 2023 from 10:17 to 15:52 US/Pacific, Dialogflow Customer Experience (Dialogflow CX) and Dialogflow Essentials (Dialogflow ES) experienced elevated DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, UNAVAILABLE errors and latency for certain functions for a duration of 5 hours, 35 minutes. High error rates were seen for CreateConversation, CreateParticipant, and (Streaming)AnalyzeContent functionalities. Any customer applications or services dependent on Dialogflow “global-dialogflow.googleapis.com” or “dialogflow.googleapis.com” would have experienced service interruptions. Only [“Global” location](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail\n) was affected by the issue and no other locations were affected.\nTo our Dialogflow customers whose applications were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is exhaustion of thread and memory resources in the component that handles incoming and outgoing API requests. The exhaustion was triggered by recent code changes to improve the efficiency of interactions between Dialogflow API, Pub/Sub messaging, and internal authentication services, and by the unexpected behavior of some incoming queries.\nOne of our largest customers began trying out a new, private feature in Dialogflow. Their client behaved in an unexpected way, exposing a potential resource exhaustion involving Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions, which we use to keep conversation state synchronized between multiple platforms. To create conversations using Dialogflow, topic subscriptions are initialized. Once conversations are completed, these subscriptions are cleared. As a result of the recent code change, customer projects that initiated conversations without completing them started to accumulate topic subscriptions, leading to a backlog.\nThe resource exhaustion only became apparent after we received a large volume of traffic that exhibited this unusual behavior on 28 July 2023. This manifested in our servers as spiking memory usage and thread exhaustion. When the pool of available threads began to dwindle, the incident started impacting other customers as well.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by an internal monitoring system on 28 July 2023 at 10:36 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. From the initial analysis, Google engineers found that the majority of errors were from one data center. At 11:25 US/Pacific, a mitigation was attempted by directing the traffic away from that data center. This attempt did not resolve the errors, instead the issue moved to another data center. After further investigation, the engineering team identified that many threads were waiting for specific event completion. Google engineers temporarily disabled those events at 13:10 US/Pacific. This showed signs of improvement in error rate and latency. However, around 30 minutes later, the issue re-appeared.\nGoogle engineers continued the investigation and identified a rollout from 17 July 2023 to be contributing to the issue and initiated a rollback at 14:20 US/Pacific. At 15:25 US/Pacific, the engineering team started noticing an improvement in error rate, and the customer impact was completely mitigated at 15:52 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Implement a fix to thread resource exhaustion triggered by queries that do not complete the conversation properly.\n* Implement safeguards to gradually roll out changes to limit the scope of impact.\n* Implement monitoring for queries that do not exit properly upon completion of conversations.\n* Improve traffic isolation by implementing separate resource pools for different types of API requests.\n* Improve traffic handling in the component that handles the API requests by implementing a safety mechanism that allows for graceful handling of overload conditions.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, 28 July 2023 from 10:17 to 15:52 US/Pacific, requests to Dialogflow CX and Dialogflow ES experienced elevated DEADLINE_EXCEEDED errors and latency issues. - Around 9% of overall traffic to “global-dialogflow.googleapis.com” or “dialogflow.googleapis.com” was experiencing elevated error rates and latency. - Based on analysis from the previous day requests, we estimate that around 25% of expected traffic to [“Global” location](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail\n) was served UNAVAILABLE errors.\nDepending on the workload and query distribution, some customers may have noticed higher error rates than the rates provided above.\n-------------------------","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Tokyo (asia-northeast1)","id":"asia-northeast1"},{"title":"Mumbai (asia-south1)","id":"asia-south1"},{"title":"Singapore (asia-southeast1)","id":"asia-southeast1"},{"title":"Sydney (australia-southeast1)","id":"australia-southeast1"},{"title":"Belgium (europe-west1)","id":"europe-west1"},{"title":"London (europe-west2)","id":"europe-west2"},{"title":"Frankfurt (europe-west3)","id":"europe-west3"},{"title":"Global","id":"global"},{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"},{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"}]},"status_impact":"SERVICE_OUTAGE","severity":"high","service_key":"zall","service_name":"Multiple Products","affected_products":[{"title":"Dialogflow CX","id":"BnCicQdHSdxaCv8Ya6Vm"},{"title":"Dialogflow ES","id":"sQqrYvhjMT5crPHKWJFY"}],"uri":"incidents/R73Toy3jkK59cd85XWtA","currently_affected_locations":[],"previously_affected_locations":[{"title":"Tokyo (asia-northeast1)","id":"asia-northeast1"},{"title":"Mumbai (asia-south1)","id":"asia-south1"},{"title":"Singapore (asia-southeast1)","id":"asia-southeast1"},{"title":"Sydney (australia-southeast1)","id":"australia-southeast1"},{"title":"Belgium (europe-west1)","id":"europe-west1"},{"title":"London (europe-west2)","id":"europe-west2"},{"title":"Frankfurt (europe-west3)","id":"europe-west3"},{"title":"Global","id":"global"},{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"},{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"}]},{"id":"1pLp2jKxWiiMPFXPHXkh","number":"13509087039569790068","begin":"2023-07-27T14:44:11+00:00","created":"2023-07-27T15:09:47+00:00","end":"2023-07-27T18:00:44+00:00","modified":"2023-07-28T19:34:21+00:00","external_desc":"Customers with Cloud products in asia-south2 or Cloud Interconnects in Delhi can face partial packet loss. ","updates":[{"created":"2023-07-28T19:34:21+00:00","modified":"2023-07-28T19:34:21+00:00","when":"2023-07-28T19:34:21+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 July 2023 at 06:30\n**Incident End:** 29 July 2023 at 08:03\n**Duration:** 4 days, 1 hour, 33 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nChronicle Security\n**Regions/Zones:** Multi-regions: us\n**Description:**\nStarting on Tuesday, 25 July at 06:30, Chronicle Security began experiencing a slow down in data processing in the US region. This resulted in stale data for Unified Data Model (UDM) [1] Search and delayed threat detections. Chronicle's data processing returned to normal for new events on Wednesday, 27 July at 13:45, with the last events in the incident window processed by customer rules by Saturday, 29 July at 08:03. From a preliminary analysis, the root cause was a surge in traffic from a single customer that occurred on Saturday 22 July. The traffic surge was exacerbated by a pipeline that did not have sufficient rate limiting and ultimately overloaded our persistence layer.\nGoogle engineers mitigated the issue by temporarily limiting the traffic from the high volume customer, removing inter-dependency from as many pipelines as possible, and by disabling several non-critical pipelines.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAll features in Chronicle Security were still working but the impacted users could have got stale data while searching for UDM events and may have experienced missed threat detections for recently ingested telemetry.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/event-processing/udm-overview","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"}]},{"created":"2023-07-29T15:12:19+00:00","modified":"2023-07-29T15:12:24+00:00","when":"2023-07-29T15:12:19+00:00","text":"The issue with Chronicle Security has been resolved for all affected users as of Saturday, 2023-07-29 08:10 US/Pacific.\nWe thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the issue.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"}]},{"created":"2023-07-27T20:47:55+00:00","modified":"2023-07-27T20:47:59+00:00","when":"2023-07-27T20:47:55+00:00","text":"Summary: Chronicle Security customers may experience data staleness or missed detections in US regions.\nDescription: The issue with Chronicle Security where data was stale on instances is mitigated for a majority of users.\nFull resolution of data staleness and the missing detections from the impact period is expected to complete by Saturday, 2023-07-29 10:00 US/Pacific.\nWe will provide an update by Saturday, 2023-07-29 10:15 US/Pacific with current details.\nDiagnosis: All features in Chronicle are still working but the impacted users may get stale data while searching for UDM events, and they may experience missed threat detections for recently ingested telemetry.\nAll data ingested on or before 2023-07-25 08:30 US/Pacific has been processed successfully.

Indexed UDM searches must leverage one of the following UDM fields and one of the following UDM nouns.

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 July 2023 at 06:30\n**Incident End:** 29 July 2023 at 08:03\n**Duration:** 4 days, 1 hour, 33 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nChronicle Security\n**Regions/Zones:** Multi-regions: us\n**Description:**\nStarting on Tuesday, 25 July at 06:30, Chronicle Security began experiencing a slow down in data processing in the US region. This resulted in stale data for Unified Data Model (UDM) [1] Search and delayed threat detections. Chronicle's data processing returned to normal for new events on Wednesday, 27 July at 13:45, with the last events in the incident window processed by customer rules by Saturday, 29 July at 08:03. From a preliminary analysis, the root cause was a surge in traffic from a single customer that occurred on Saturday 22 July. The traffic surge was exacerbated by a pipeline that did not have sufficient rate limiting and ultimately overloaded our persistence layer.\nGoogle engineers mitigated the issue by temporarily limiting the traffic from the high volume customer, removing inter-dependency from as many pipelines as possible, and by disabling several non-critical pipelines.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAll features in Chronicle Security were still working but the impacted users could have got stale data while searching for UDM events and may have experienced missed threat detections for recently ingested telemetry.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/event-processing/udm-overview","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"}]},"status_impact":"SERVICE_DISRUPTION","severity":"medium","service_key":"FHwvkSZ6RzzDYAvDZXMM","service_name":"Chronicle Security","affected_products":[{"title":"Chronicle Security","id":"FHwvkSZ6RzzDYAvDZXMM"}],"uri":"incidents/kVn7cDezHPmNh3AubTGH","currently_affected_locations":[],"previously_affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"}]},{"id":"F4YmBbnhuKtQ2rEYcMDs","number":"7758454363992819042","begin":"2023-07-23T01:30:32+00:00","created":"2023-07-23T02:14:42+00:00","end":"2023-07-23T09:18:43+00:00","modified":"2023-07-23T09:18:43+00:00","external_desc":"Vertex AI training jobs are experiencing issues where jobs may take longer than usual ","updates":[{"created":"2023-07-23T09:18:34+00:00","modified":"2023-07-23T09:18:46+00:00","when":"2023-07-23T09:18:34+00:00","text":"The issue with Vertex AI Training has been resolved for all affected users as of Sunday, 2023-07-23 02:09 US/Pacific.\nWe thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the issue.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong (asia-east2)","id":"asia-east2"},{"title":"Tokyo (asia-northeast1)","id":"asia-northeast1"},{"title":"Seoul (asia-northeast3)","id":"asia-northeast3"},{"title":"Mumbai (asia-south1)","id":"asia-south1"},{"title":"Singapore (asia-southeast1)","id":"asia-southeast1"},{"title":"Sydney (australia-southeast1)","id":"australia-southeast1"},{"title":"Belgium (europe-west1)","id":"europe-west1"},{"title":"London (europe-west2)","id":"europe-west2"},{"title":"Frankfurt (europe-west3)","id":"europe-west3"},{"title":"Netherlands (europe-west4)","id":"europe-west4"},{"title":"Zurich (europe-west6)","id":"europe-west6"},{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"},{"title":"Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)","id":"northamerica-northeast2"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"},{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Northern Virginia (us-east4)","id":"us-east4"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"},{"title":"Los Angeles (us-west2)","id":"us-west2"}]},{"created":"2023-07-23T03:02:22+00:00","modified":"2023-07-23T03:02:26+00:00","when":"2023-07-23T03:02:22+00:00","text":"Summary: Vertex AI training jobs are experiencing issues where jobs may take longer than usual \nDescription: Mitigation work is currently underway by our engineering team.\nThe mitigation is expected to complete by Sunday, 2023-07-23 02:00 US/Pacific.\nWe will provide more information by Sunday, 2023-07-23 02:30 US/Pacific.\nDiagnosis: Vertex AI training jobs are experiencing issues where jobs may take longer than usual .

The extra log messages consumed additional logging API write quota, and a subset of customers had quota exhaustion issues. The issue affected both standard and autopilot clusters at GKE versions 1.24.x and above. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a roll out of a new version of the component responsible for processing logs.\nDuring the outage, customers were provided with a workaround to request a quota increase for Logging API and/or to apply log exclusions to avoid storing the additional messages. The issue was mitigated by a gradual fix roll out to the affected clusters.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected Customers would have seen unexpected additional log messages in GKE cluster logs.

The extra log messages consumed additional logging API write quota, and a subset of customers had quota exhaustion issues. The issue affected both standard and autopilot clusters at GKE versions 1.24.x and above. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a roll out of a new version of the component responsible for processing logs.\nDuring the outage, customers were provided with a workaround to request a quota increase for Logging API and/or to apply log exclusions to avoid storing the additional messages. The issue was mitigated by a gradual fix roll out to the affected clusters.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected Customers would have seen unexpected additional log messages in GKE cluster logs. Following are the Error/Warning log entries:\n- Failed to get record: decoder: failed to decode payload: EOF\n- Cannot parse '0609 05:31:59.491654' after %L\n- Invalid time format %m%d %H:%M:%S.%L%z

07:29 US/Pacific, some Google Cloud customers in us-west1 and multiregion-us received intermittent “403 access denied errors” while using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or attempting to access Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for a duration of 6 hours and 45 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Cloud’s common authentication infrastructure provides short-lived, forwardable internal credentials for establishing user presence. Production jobs use a public key to verify the signature from this authentication platform. This public key is periodically rotated to increase security.\nIn this case, updated public keys were successfully rolled out to \u003e99.99% of machines but failed to roll out to one machine before the previous keys became stale. Tasks scheduled on machines with stale keys returned an internal authentication failure that was translated to an access-denied error (HTTP 403) in the us-west1 region and the US-multi-region. This resulted in a small number of customers experiencing intermittent access denied errors despite having correct credentials.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via a customer support case on 19 June 2023 at 07:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified an affected machine that was using a stale public key as part of our internal authentication infrastructure. Engineers took standard mitigating actions, by stopping the serving path process within 10 minutes of identifying the affected machine, and confirmed full mitigation within another 4 minutes. Services were fully recovered on 19 June 2023 at 14:14 US/Pacific,\nGoogle is committed to preventing future recurrence, and we are taking the following actions:\n- Immediately complete an audit of all machines containing public keys to find the rare cases of unobserved stale public keys and reinstall those machines to prevent unnecessary authorization failures.\n- Optimize detection of stale public keys.\n- Design and implement a long term solution eliminating rare edge case failures in key rotation for Cloud authentication infrastructure.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"}]},{"created":"2023-06-20T23:50:35+00:00","modified":"2023-06-20T23:50:35+00:00","when":"2023-06-20T23:50:35+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

This led to a failure to verify all requests that were handled by the affected machine.\nGoogle will share a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause. Google is immediately starting an audit of other machines containing authorization tokens to ensure that the incident is not repeated. We are also working on a permanent fix to prevent this situation from happening in the future, and improving our ability to quickly detect this issue if it ever happens again.\n**Customer Impact:**\nGoogle Cloud Storage customers in the impacted regions would have received intermittent 403 errors on accessing and/or writing into the GCS bucket. Customers may have also received errors stating that the request had invalid authentication credentials, despite using a valid account.\nA small amount of Google Kubernetes Engine customers in the us-west1 region may have received intermittent 403 errors on GKE node when calling GKE APIs.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"}]},{"created":"2023-06-19T21:54:25+00:00","modified":"2023-06-19T21:54:26+00:00","when":"2023-06-19T21:54:25+00:00","text":"The issue with Google Cloud Storage, Google Kubernetes Engine has been resolved for all affected projects as of Monday, 2023-06-19 14:13 US/Pacific.\nWe thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the issue.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"}]},{"created":"2023-06-19T21:42:01+00:00","modified":"2023-06-19T21:42:03+00:00","when":"2023-06-19T21:42:01+00:00","text":"Summary: Multiple products reporting 403 access denied issue in us-west1 and multiregion-us\nDescription: We are experiencing an issue with GCS and GKE products beginning on Monday, 2023-06-19 7:30 US/Pacific.\nMitigation work is currently underway by our engineering team.\nWe do not have an ETA for mitigation at this point.\nWe will provide more information by Monday, 2023-06-19 15:15 US/Pacific.\nDiagnosis: Customers may experience 403 access denied errors while accessing these products\nWorkaround: None at this time.","status":"SERVICE_DISRUPTION","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"}]},{"created":"2023-06-19T21:16:53+00:00","modified":"2023-06-19T21:16:54+00:00","when":"2023-06-19T21:16:53+00:00","text":"Summary: Multiple products reporting 403 access denied issue in us-west1 and multiregion-us\nDescription: We are experiencing an issue with GCS and GKE products beginning on Monday, 2023-06-19 7:30 US/Pacific.\nOur engineering team continues to investigate the root cause of the issue.

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 7 May, 2023 12:47\n**Incident End:** 7 May, 2023 17:06\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 19 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloud SQL\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nCloud SQL customers experienced “Invalid Request” errors when attempting to create read replicas for a duration of 4 hours, 19 minutes. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a recent change where the Cloud Console UI stopped sending private IP information to the Cloud SQL Admin API for creating read replica requests.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers would have experienced the error “Invalid request: At least one of Public or Private IP connectivity must be enabled” when attempting to create a Cloud SQL read replica in Cloud Console.\n**Additional details:**\nGoogle engineers mitigated the issue on 7 May 2023 at 17:06 US/Pacific by rolling back the recent change made to the Cloud Console UI.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong (asia-east2)","id":"asia-east2"},{"title":"Tokyo

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a recent change where the Cloud Console UI stopped sending private IP information to the Cloud SQL Admin API for creating read replica requests.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers would have experienced the error “Invalid request: At least one of Public or Private IP connectivity must be enabled” when attempting to create a Cloud SQL read replica in Cloud Console.\n**Additional details:**\nGoogle engineers mitigated the issue on 7 May 2023 at 17:06 US/Pacific by rolling back the recent change made to the Cloud Console UI.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong (asia-east2)","id":"asia-east2"},{"title":"Tokyo

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking measures to improve our service.\n## Root Cause and Trigger\nBigQuery is adding a new INFORMATION_SCHEMA view that gives users a more detailed view of their billed storage usage. The view is populated by a background data processing pipeline that outputs a storage usage row for all tables in a project or organization. To guarantee the accurate and consistent delivery of each record, BigQuery uses a Queue database to update batches of rows for tables in a GCP project. The queue database is a shared resource for our metadata subsystem. A sharding technique based on project unique IDs was implemented to distribute the load on the queue database. However, this technique proved problematic due to the high level of skew in terms of the distribution of work among projects in the reporting set. As a result, projects with a significant amount of work caused the queue database performance to degrade in the shards hosting projects with such high load. It is worth noting that this skew is more pronounced in the US multi-region.\nThe pipeline was rolling out gradually, per region, across the BigQuery fleet. On Thursday, 27 April 2023, it was enabled in the US multi-region, and it started running on Friday, 28 April 2023 at 06:00 US/Pacific. At 14:24 US/Pacific, the pipeline reached the stage of submitting tasks to the queue database which triggered the problem. Shards of the queue database corresponding to skewed project load started pushing back under high load. Other queue tasks corresponding to operations on the serving path like Table Copy, Load, and Query collocated with the servers pushing back were consequently impacted.\nThe user visible impact for the affected operations manifested as internal errors due to operations exceeding their deadlines, or increased tail latencies for successful ones.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nOn Friday, 28 April 2023 at 18:47 US/Pacific, Google engineers were alerted to elevated job connection errors on different job types and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers quickly halted and initiated a rollback of a binary release at 20:00 US/Pacific however, this did not mitigate the issue. The issue was further escalated at 22:48 US/Pacific, and engineers initiated several mitigation attempts which were unsuccessful. On Saturday, 29 April 2023 12:36:00 US/Pacific engineers identified and terminated the problematic job, and the issue was fully mitigated by 13:10 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions: - Enhance our detection procedures for internal or external triggers that cause increased resource load. - Improve internal rollout procedures for pipelines that utilize the queue databases to control the pace of scaling up their traffic. - Develop job monitoring dashboards for the queue databases to detect errors or latency issues and reduce time to mitigation. - Redesign the pipeline that triggered the incident to avoid overloading the system. - Develop an isolation mechanism to prioritize critical workloads over background database jobs.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, 28 April 2023 from 14:24 to Saturday, 29 April 2023 13:10 US/Pacific, Google BigQuery experienced elevated connection errors impacting BigQuery jobs.\n- Approximately 8.56% of projects in the US multi-region, observed elevated connection errors, others might have seen elevated latency at the tail end of metadata API operations while attempting to execute jobs in the US multiregion.\n- At the peak of the incident between Friday, 28 April 2023 17:00 and Saturday, 29 April 2023 01:00 US/Pacific: - ~3.7% of all projects in the US multi-region saw an error ratio \u003e 1% across all job types. - ~37% of projects saw an error ratio \u003e 0.01%. - Table Copy jobs were the most severely affected (almost 2% at peak). - Query and load operations observed errors between 0.1% and 1%.\n---","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"}]},{"created":"2023-05-02T14:17:06+00:00","modified":"2023-05-02T14:17:06+00:00","when":"2023-05-02T14:17:06+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and resilience.**\n### Water Leak and Fire Damage\nOn Tuesday, 25 April 2023 at 16:46 US/Pacific, a cooling system water pipe leak occurred in one of the data centers in the europe-west9 region. The leak originated in a non-Google portion of the facility, entered an associated uninterruptible power supply (UPS) room, and led to a fire. The fire required evacuation of the facility, engagement from the local fire department, and a power shutdown of the entire data center building for several hours. The fire was successfully controlled on 26 April 2023 at 04:11 US/Pacific.\n### Regional Impact\nEurope-west9 contains three buildings with independent cooling, power, and networking. Regional Spanner supports the regional control plane for most Google Cloud services in the region. In europe-west9, regional Spanner’s replicas were not correctly distributed across the three buildings in the region to ensure quorum was available after the impacted building was powered down. As a result, the control plane services for many Google Cloud services were interrupted in europe-west9, causing unavailability and/or elevated error rates for these services in this region. Regional Spanner was restored on 26 April 2023 at 12:47 US/Pacific.\nThe Identity and Authentication Management (IAM) service in europe-west9 depends upon regional Spanner. After regional Spanner came back online, IAM recovered on 26 April 2023 at 14:42 US/Pacific. IAM recovery took longer than expected, driven by the time to refresh the policies for the region as a result of the outage. Some Google Cloud services that were impacted by this event began recovering soon after Spanner and IAM were back online.\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD) experienced regional impact in both the data plane (GCE Virtual Machines (VMs), PD Volumes) and control plane systems. Both systems had extended recovery periods after Spanner and IAM were restored. GCE VMs and PDs in europe-west9 zones were online by 19:00 US/Pacific, except for 58% of GCE VMs in zone europe-west9-a, which were directly impacted by the water leak. Soon after Spanner, IAM, GCE/PD were online, the europe-west9 region was primarily recovered and operational.\n### Global Service Impact\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) control plane provides the underlying control plane for Google Cloud Platform. A small number of methods within the GCE control plane API must collect information from multiple regions or zones by making requests to each regional control plane (called fanout requests). Google Cloud services including Cloud Console depend on these methods. When the GCE control plane for the europe-west9 region and zones went offline, some of these fanout methods did not operate correctly. During the outage, this led to global unavailability for some pages and control plane operations within Cloud Console. The global impact that was observed due to fanout issues in the Google Cloud Console control plane was mitigated by removing the europe-west9 control plane from the set of visible regions on Wednesday, 26 April 2023 at 03:38 US/Pacific.\n## Key Events and Timeline\nIncluded below is a brief timeline of the overall incident. Additional details are provided in the following sections. All times and dates are listed in the US/Pacific time zone.\n### Tuesday, 25 April 2023\n16:46 - Water leakage began on Level 2 above europe-west9-a zone.\n17:31 - Google engineers were proactively alerted about a potential critical impact to one cluster (a collection of servers along with supporting equipment for networking, power, and cooling) supporting our europe-west9-a zone due to water leak in its data center room.\n18:30 - Google started to gradually bring down Google Compute Engine (GCE) virtual machine instances along with Persistent Disk (PD) volumes from this cluster supporting the europe-west9-a zone.\n18:37 - As a preventative measure, engineers decided to preemptively power down all equipment supporting one of the clusters in europe-west9-a.\n19:14 - Smoke was detected in the building with the water leakage.\n19:42 - Completed power down of the impacted cluster with the water leak. 58% percent of GCE instances and 55% of PD volumes taken out of service from europe-west9-a zone.\n19:45 - The local fire department was called.\n20:00 - Fire department arrived on site and took over incident command of the building fire.\n20:08 - Google engineers were alerted to the battery room water leak and fire.\n22:45 - Building fire suppression system water supply ran out.\n22:51 - Google engineers notified that the fire department has ordered building power to be shut down.\n**23:04 - Emergency shutdown commenced for one of the three buildings in europe-west9 on order of the fire marshal. At this time regional impact occurred because Regional Spanner lost quorum. The global outage begins for some fanout Google Cloud APIs and Google Cloud Console operations across a number of services.**\n### Wednesday, 26 April 2023\n00:52 - Battery Room Fire Suppression System Restored\n03:38 - Google engineers removed the europe-west9 region from the list of available regions for Compute Engine. This restored services for Google Cloud Console globally and resumed instance creation for customers whose projects use global scope internal DNS. Global instance creation for Google Cloud SQL is also restored.\n04:11 - Battery room fire reported to be extinguished.\n10:00 - Availability of global dataset/job list operations is restored for BigQuery customers with data in europe-west9 by excluding the europe-west9 region.\n**12:47 - Regional Spanner quorum is restored and internal Spanner operations resume.**\n13:00 - Fire department confirmed the battery temperatures were stabilized, and the majority of the fire crew departed.\n**14:42 - Regional IAM services are restored.**\n15:14 - Google Cloud Storage (GCS) regional services are restored.\n15:30 - Cloud Pub/Sub services are restored.\n17:10 - Google BigQuery service is fully restored for europe-west9 region.\n18:40 - Google Cloud Dataflow services are restored.\n**19:00 - Google Compute Engine Control plane services restored across all zones.**\nFor the cluster in europe-west9-a that was not affected by the water leak, Google Compute Engine instances and Persistent Disk volumes were restored. This resulted in 42% of instances and volumes in zone europe-west9-a being restored. The remaining cluster in europe-west9-a that was affected by the water leak also had smoke damage. The severity of the smoke damage led to the whole cluster being decommissioned. Before decommissioning the cluster, we cleaned it and fully recovered all zonal data from the cluster.\nAfter Spanner, IAM and GCE/PD had recovered at 19:00, the europe-west9 region was primarily recovered and operational.\n## Water Leak, Mitigation, and Prevention\nOn Tuesday, 25 April 2023 at 17:31 US/Pacific, Google engineers were proactively alerted about a potential critical impact to the europe-west9-a cloud zone and immediately started an investigation. Our Europe regional Security Operations Center was immediately engaged, and it was discovered that water had leaked from a non-Google room above onto the first floor of our facility for one of the clusters in zone europe-west9-a. As a preventative measure, engineers decided to preemptively power down all equipment supporting this one cluster with water leak in europe-west9-a at 18:37 US/Pacific.\nAt 19:14 US/Pacific, smoke was detected in the building and at 19:45 US/Pacific, the local fire department was called. When they arrived onsite at 20:00 US/Pacific, the fire marshal informed Google engineers that a full building shutdown was imminent to allow for fire fighting activities. Shortly thereafter, at 20:08 US/Pacific, we were alerted that a battery room had also flooded, and the room had caught fire. At 22:45 US/Pacific, we were informed that the fire suppression system had run out of water. Once firefighters arrived on site, they began the process of connecting the battery room suppression system to the city fire water system.\nAt 22:59 US/Pacific, upon notification from the local fire marshal that a full building shut down was imminent, Google engineers proactively started to migrate the workloads from the building and completely powered it down at 23:29 US/Pacific. At this time regional impact occurred because regional Spanner no longer had quorum, due to a misconfiguration. It had two of its quorum in the building powered down, instead of being correctly spread across the three buildings in the europe-west9 region. At this time, some global APIs that aggregate information from each region by making a request to each regional control plane (called fanout requests) began to fail.\nThe local fire department continued to fight the fire in the UPS battery room on the lower floor of the facility and to control the fire. The facility fire continued to pose a threat of re-igniting until Wednesday, 26 April 2023 at 11:00 US/Pacific.\nUnfortunately, it took nearly 16 hours to extinguish the fire in the battery room, which delayed recovery efforts for the impacted building. Once it was clear to the Google Cloud team that power and cooling would not be further affected by the events impacting europe-west9-a, Google started working to bring back the clusters in the impacted building. The cluster in zone-a that had water intrusion also had smoke damage and continued to remain powered off and access was restricted for safety and security reasons. The fire introduced water and soot contamination to the data center space for this cluster in zone europe-west9-a. The affected racks of servers in the cluster supporting europe-west9-a had to be taken apart, thoroughly cleaned, and re-assembled before they could be powered on again for recovery of the zonal data before decommissioning the cluster.\nAll equipment was thoroughly cleaned using professional cleaning services. These services also began pumping out the standing water on Saturday, 29 April 2023. The cleaning efforts included reducing high humidity levels, clearance of rubble from the facility battery room, cleaning of all physical equipment, and cleaning of greasy soot contaminations (which was observed throughout the impacted cluster in zone europe-west9-a). After the cluster was cleaned we then performed a staged power-on approach for this cluster in zone europe-west9-a to recover customer zonal data. After a successful multi-day power restoration process, Google engineers were able to power on all the equipment in the cluster and recovered all zonal data in europe-west9-a. Customers experienced no data loss from the incident.\nGoogle has controls in place to detect and mitigate the risk of fire safety issues. These controls are audited by both internal teams with due diligence and operational reviews and by Google Cloud’s external auditors. These control objectives apply to all Google Cloud regions in facilities operated by third parties. Google Cloud regions (whether operated by Google Cloud or third parties) are also audited against Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) controls in place that support their ISO 22301 certification [1].\nIn addition, we are executing the following actions to prevent a recurrence of this issue\n- Detailed risk analysis for water intrusion in all data centers that host Google Cloud and implement any corrective actions based on findings.\n- Evaluating installation of drip trays for all Google spaces within multi-story data center locations with water on floors above.\n- Refining our fire and flood recovery playbook to include lessons learned from this event.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/iso-22301\n## Google Cloud Services on the critical path for restoring Region\n### Regional Spanner\nGoogle uses an internal version of regional Spanner as a back-end database to several Google Cloud services such as IAM and various control planes that manage our infrastructure and services for a region. The outage had a regional impact as this regional Spanner was not configured correctly across the three buildings in the region for it to maintain its quorum. Regional Spanner should have had one replica in each of the three buildings in the region. Instead, it had two of its three replicas in two different clusters in the building that was powered down. As a result, regional Spanner no longer met quorum across the region impacting IAM and the control planes in the region. On Wednesday, 26 April 2023 at 12:47 US/Pacific, Regional Spanner’s quorum was restored, which then allowed IAM and the region's control planes to begin recovery. We are currently conducting a detailed per-region audit (and conducting any required remediation if needed) of our internal regional Spanner allocations to confirm all regions fully meet Google Cloud expectations for fault isolation to prevent this issue in the future.\n### IAM\nRegional IAM needed regional Spanner available for it to serve and process requests. After regional Spanner was brought back to service, we kept the Cloud IAM in this region offline while it sync’d to get up to date with the global view of Cloud IAM. Most customers’ policies enforced by IAM are global in nature spanning identities, folders, and projects. These policies had received no updates for 13 hours in this region and any security critical updates made by customers during this period would not be available there if we had brought it online without syncing. For example, if a user was taken out of a critical IAM role for a storage bucket, the IAM server in the region would not yet know about it. Out of an abundance of caution, and treating our customers’ security as paramount, we decided to not serve traffic for IAM in europe-west9 until it completed full synchronization, and began serving traffic with up-to-date policies at 14:42 US/Pacific.\nTo address this recovery delay, we are implementing changes to our IAM policy refresh mechanism to ensure any stale policies (as a result of outages) are synchronized and resolved in less than 15 minutes. We are achieving this by providing improvements in replicating policies and parallelizing the synchronization when recovery is needed.\n### Google Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD)\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD) experienced regional impact in both the data plane (GCE VMs, PD Volumes) and control plane systems. Both systems had extended recovery periods after Spanner and IAM were restored.\nRegional Persistent Disk (PD) replicates volumes across multiple zones. To ensure proper quorum, Regional PD maintains a lease for each volume in a regional Spanner database. No Regional PD volumes had both replicas in the same building within the region. However, 79% of regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west9 region had one replica in the impacted building. When Spanner was offline in the region, these volumes could not establish quorum, and therefore became read-only as a failsafe measure. If Regional Spanner had not gone offline, Regional Persistent Disk (PD) would have ensured that the Regional PD volumes with one replica would work as expected (as detailed in the RePD documentation[2]) to enable customer workloads to continue operating in the available zone.\nSpanner and IAM were online by 26 April 2023 at 14:42 US/Pacific. Excluding the 58% of GCE VMs in europe-west9-a directly impacted by the water leak, the VMs and PDs in europe-west9-a were online by 19:00 US/Pacific. This time was to validate Persistent Disk integrity, to ensure that all volumes were ready for production operations before customer VMs were restarted, and then re-enable persistent disk operations. This took longer than expected due to a suspected issue with the PD health check verifier that reported errors. These were false positives due to an issue in starting up this many PDs at once. As soon as the team confirmed that the PD volumes were healthy we initiated the recovery process.\nTo ensure we don’t have these additional delays for PD in the future we are:\n1. Updating the PD startup process to eliminate the false positive errors.\n2. Parallelizing the PD start up process to allow it to complete faster.\n3. Improving configuration rollout time across the fleet used in this type of recovery.\nThe GCE control plane experienced a regional impact due to a dependence on regional Spanner. After regional Spanner recovered, the recovery time of the GCE control plane was extended due to the time required to revert service configuration changes that were made as part of the initial mitigation of global control plane impact. During the incident, the GCE control plane experienced some fanout API issues. To mitigate this impact, the GCE control plane was reconfigured on 26 April 2023 at 03:38 US/Pacific to remove the europe-west9 region and zones. When the IAM service was restored, this configuration change was reverted. Restoring europe-west9 to the set of active GCE regions required two sequential configuration changes. Google Cloud configuration changes of this nature are deployed gradually with an incremental rollout. The first configuration change started at 14:53 US/Pacific and completed at 15:33 US/Pacific. The second configuration change, which brought the europe-west9 region and zones back online, started at 15:46 US/Pacific and finished with the last zone at 19:00 US/Pacific. At this point the GCE control plane was fully operational.\nTo improve the mitigation and recovery time in the future GCE will:\n* Improve the testing process of removing and restoring a GCE control plane for a zonal and regional issue.\n* Ensure that API methods which require access to all regions and zones degrade gracefully when a control plane scope is unavailable.\n* Ensure that the Cloud Console continues to operate when a control plane scope is unavailable.\n[2] - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#repds\n### Enhanced Zonal \u0026 Regional Failure Testing\nWe are adding improvements to our zonal and regional environment to test for and ensure system behavior is as intended across all services in the case of zonal and regional outages. This includes validating that critical services consistently meet our expectations for how they allocate resources within our physical failure domains, that automated verification tests are in place to ensure no regressions, and ensure recovery times are efficient.\n## Global Google Cloud Impact and Restoration\nCloud Console provides a global view of Google Cloud resources. Certain Cloud Console pages rely on GCE backend APIs to perform global aggregated fanout across the regions. Some of these APIs failed to operate correctly while europe-west-9 was unavailable, rather than returning partial data. The global impact that was observed due to fanout issues in the Google Cloud Console control plane was mitigated by removing the europe-west9 control plane from the set of visible regions on Wednesday, 26 April 2023 at 03:38 US/Pacific. We are updating the Cloud Console so that fanout API methods continue to operate as expected to prevent this issue from occuring again. In addition, we are performing an audit (and any required remediation) across our services for any instances of fanout methods that could have similar issues.\nGCE provides an Internal DNS [3] feature to enable customers to look up instance names within their project. This service can be configured to either register instance names in a single Global namespace or in multiple Zonal namespaces. During the outage, customers using the Global namespace for Internal DNS for VM creation were unable to complete if the project had VMs in europe-west9, since it requires coordination with all zones where the project has resources to avoid duplicate instance DNS names. Customers using Zonal namespace for Internal DNS did not experience this impact. It is recommended to use Internal DNS with Zonal namespaces for your project (please see the documentation [3] for details).\n[3] - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns\n## Mitigation \u0026 Prevention of Additional Services\nAfter Regional Spanner, IAM and GCE/PD came back online for the region, almost all of the services in the region fully recovered soon after that. The following services either took longer to recover or had additional impact during the outage.\n- Google Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud SQL, Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud Dataflow\nPlease log a case with our Support team if you would like to receive additional information regarding these services.\nWe thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the outage and completing our investigation. We apologize to our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps outlined in this IR and more to improve our platform’s performance and resilience.\n---","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Paris (europe-west9)","id":"europe-west9"},{"title":"Global","id":"global"}]},{"created":"2023-04-27T13:39:35+00:00","modified":"2023-04-27T13:40:50+00:00","when":"2023-04-27T13:39:35+00:00","text":"Summary: Multiple Google Cloud services in the europe-west9-a zone are impacted\nDescription: Water intrusion in a data center in europe-west9 caused a multi-cluster failure that led to a shutdown of multiple zones.

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and resilience.**\n### Water Leak and Fire Damage\nOn Tuesday, 25 April 2023 at 16:46 US/Pacific, a cooling system water pipe leak occurred in one of the data centers in the europe-west9 region. The leak originated in a non-Google portion of the facility, entered an associated uninterruptible power supply (UPS) room, and led to a fire. The fire required evacuation of the facility, engagement from the local fire department, and a power shutdown of the entire data center building for several hours. The fire was successfully controlled on 26 April 2023 at 04:11 US/Pacific.\n### Regional Impact\nEurope-west9 contains three buildings with independent cooling, power, and networking. Regional Spanner supports the regional control plane for most Google Cloud services in the region. In europe-west9, regional Spanner’s replicas were not correctly distributed across the three buildings in the region to ensure quorum was available after the impacted building was powered down. As a result, the control plane services for many Google Cloud services were interrupted in europe-west9, causing unavailability and/or elevated error rates for these services in this region. Regional Spanner was restored on 26 April 2023 at 12:47 US/Pacific.\nThe Identity and Authentication Management (IAM) service in europe-west9 depends upon regional Spanner. After regional Spanner came back online, IAM recovered on 26 April 2023 at 14:42 US/Pacific. IAM recovery took longer than expected, driven by the time to refresh the policies for the region as a result of the outage. Some Google Cloud services that were impacted by this event began recovering soon after Spanner and IAM were back online.\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD) experienced regional impact in both the data plane (GCE Virtual Machines (VMs), PD Volumes) and control plane systems. Both systems had extended recovery periods after Spanner and IAM were restored. GCE VMs and PDs in europe-west9 zones were online by 19:00 US/Pacific, except for 58% of GCE VMs in zone europe-west9-a, which were directly impacted by the water leak. Soon after Spanner, IAM, GCE/PD were online, the europe-west9 region was primarily recovered and operational.\n### Global Service Impact\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) control plane provides the underlying control plane for Google Cloud Platform. A small number of methods within the GCE control plane API must collect information from multiple regions or zones by making requests to each regional control plane (called fanout requests). Google Cloud services including Cloud Console depend on these methods. When the GCE control plane for the europe-west9 region and zones went offline, some of these fanout methods did not operate correctly. During the outage, this led to global unavailability for some pages and control plane operations within Cloud Console. The global impact that was observed due to fanout issues in the Google Cloud Console control plane was mitigated by removing the europe-west9 control plane from the set of visible regions on Wednesday, 26 April 2023 at 03:38 US/Pacific.\n## Key Events and Timeline\nIncluded below is a brief timeline of the overall incident. Additional details are provided in the following sections. All times and dates are listed in the US/Pacific time zone.\n### Tuesday, 25 April 2023\n16:46 - Water leakage began on Level 2 above europe-west9-a zone.\n17:31 - Google engineers were proactively alerted about a potential critical impact to one cluster (a collection of servers along with supporting equipment for networking, power, and cooling) supporting our europe-west9-a zone due to water leak in its data center room.\n18:30 - Google started to gradually bring down Google Compute Engine (GCE) virtual machine instances along with Persistent Disk (PD) volumes from this cluster supporting the europe-west9-a zone.\n18:37 - As a preventative measure, engineers decided to preemptively power down all equipment supporting one of the clusters in europe-west9-a.\n19:14 - Smoke was detected in the building with the water leakage.\n19:42 - Completed power down of the impacted cluster with the water leak. 58% percent of GCE instances and 55% of PD volumes taken out of service from europe-west9-a zone.\n19:45 - The local fire department was called.\n20:00 - Fire department arrived on site and took over incident command of the building fire.\n20:08 - Google engineers were alerted to the battery room water leak and fire.\n22:45 - Building fire suppression system water supply ran out.\n22:51 - Google engineers notified that the fire department has ordered building power to be shut down.\n**23:04 - Emergency shutdown commenced for one of the three buildings in europe-west9 on order of the fire marshal. At this time regional impact occurred because Regional Spanner lost quorum. The global outage begins for some fanout Google Cloud APIs and Google Cloud Console operations across a number of services.**\n### Wednesday, 26 April 2023\n00:52 - Battery Room Fire Suppression System Restored\n03:38 - Google engineers removed the europe-west9 region from the list of available regions for Compute Engine. This restored services for Google Cloud Console globally and resumed instance creation for customers whose projects use global scope internal DNS. Global instance creation for Google Cloud SQL is also restored.\n04:11 - Battery room fire reported to be extinguished.\n10:00 - Availability of global dataset/job list operations is restored for BigQuery customers with data in europe-west9 by excluding the europe-west9 region.\n**12:47 - Regional Spanner quorum is restored and internal Spanner operations resume.**\n13:00 - Fire department confirmed the battery temperatures were stabilized, and the majority of the fire crew departed.\n**14:42 - Regional IAM services are restored.**\n15:14 - Google Cloud Storage (GCS) regional services are restored.\n15:30 - Cloud Pub/Sub services are restored.\n17:10 - Google BigQuery service is fully restored for europe-west9 region.\n18:40 - Google Cloud Dataflow services are restored.\n**19:00 - Google Compute Engine Control plane services restored across all zones.**\nFor the cluster in europe-west9-a that was not affected by the water leak, Google Compute Engine instances and Persistent Disk volumes were restored. This resulted in 42% of instances and volumes in zone europe-west9-a being restored. The remaining cluster in europe-west9-a that was affected by the water leak also had smoke damage. The severity of the smoke damage led to the whole cluster being decommissioned. Before decommissioning the cluster, we cleaned it and fully recovered all zonal data from the cluster.\nAfter Spanner, IAM and GCE/PD had recovered at 19:00, the europe-west9 region was primarily recovered and operational.\n## Water Leak, Mitigation, and Prevention\nOn Tuesday, 25 April 2023 at 17:31 US/Pacific, Google engineers were proactively alerted about a potential critical impact to the europe-west9-a cloud zone and immediately started an investigation. Our Europe regional Security Operations Center was immediately engaged, and it was discovered that water had leaked from a non-Google room above onto the first floor of our facility for one of the clusters in zone europe-west9-a. As a preventative measure, engineers decided to preemptively power down all equipment supporting this one cluster with water leak in europe-west9-a at 18:37 US/Pacific.\nAt 19:14 US/Pacific, smoke was detected in the building and at 19:45 US/Pacific, the local fire department was called. When they arrived onsite at 20:00 US/Pacific, the fire marshal informed Google engineers that a full building shutdown was imminent to allow for fire fighting activities. Shortly thereafter, at 20:08 US/Pacific, we were alerted that a battery room had also flooded, and the room had caught fire. At 22:45 US/Pacific, we were informed that the fire suppression system had run out of water. Once firefighters arrived on site, they began the process of connecting the battery room suppression system to the city fire water system.\nAt 22:59 US/Pacific, upon notification from the local fire marshal that a full building shut down was imminent, Google engineers proactively started to migrate the workloads from the building and completely powered it down at 23:29 US/Pacific. At this time regional impact occurred because regional Spanner no longer had quorum, due to a misconfiguration. It had two of its quorum in the building powered down, instead of being correctly spread across the three buildings in the europe-west9 region. At this time, some global APIs that aggregate information from each region by making a request to each regional control plane (called fanout requests) began to fail.\nThe local fire department continued to fight the fire in the UPS battery room on the lower floor of the facility and to control the fire. The facility fire continued to pose a threat of re-igniting until Wednesday, 26 April 2023 at 11:00 US/Pacific.\nUnfortunately, it took nearly 16 hours to extinguish the fire in the battery room, which delayed recovery efforts for the impacted building. Once it was clear to the Google Cloud team that power and cooling would not be further affected by the events impacting europe-west9-a, Google started working to bring back the clusters in the impacted building. The cluster in zone-a that had water intrusion also had smoke damage and continued to remain powered off and access was restricted for safety and security reasons. The fire introduced water and soot contamination to the data center space for this cluster in zone europe-west9-a. The affected racks of servers in the cluster supporting europe-west9-a had to be taken apart, thoroughly cleaned, and re-assembled before they could be powered on again for recovery of the zonal data before decommissioning the cluster.\nAll equipment was thoroughly cleaned using professional cleaning services. These services also began pumping out the standing water on Saturday, 29 April 2023. The cleaning efforts included reducing high humidity levels, clearance of rubble from the facility battery room, cleaning of all physical equipment, and cleaning of greasy soot contaminations (which was observed throughout the impacted cluster in zone europe-west9-a). After the cluster was cleaned we then performed a staged power-on approach for this cluster in zone europe-west9-a to recover customer zonal data. After a successful multi-day power restoration process, Google engineers were able to power on all the equipment in the cluster and recovered all zonal data in europe-west9-a. Customers experienced no data loss from the incident.\nGoogle has controls in place to detect and mitigate the risk of fire safety issues. These controls are audited by both internal teams with due diligence and operational reviews and by Google Cloud’s external auditors. These control objectives apply to all Google Cloud regions in facilities operated by third parties. Google Cloud regions (whether operated by Google Cloud or third parties) are also audited against Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) controls in place that support their ISO 22301 certification [1].\nIn addition, we are executing the following actions to prevent a recurrence of this issue\n- Detailed risk analysis for water intrusion in all data centers that host Google Cloud and implement any corrective actions based on findings.\n- Evaluating installation of drip trays for all Google spaces within multi-story data center locations with water on floors above.\n- Refining our fire and flood recovery playbook to include lessons learned from this event.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/iso-22301\n## Google Cloud Services on the critical path for restoring Region\n### Regional Spanner\nGoogle uses an internal version of regional Spanner as a back-end database to several Google Cloud services such as IAM and various control planes that manage our infrastructure and services for a region. The outage had a regional impact as this regional Spanner was not configured correctly across the three buildings in the region for it to maintain its quorum. Regional Spanner should have had one replica in each of the three buildings in the region. Instead, it had two of its three replicas in two different clusters in the building that was powered down. As a result, regional Spanner no longer met quorum across the region impacting IAM and the control planes in the region. On Wednesday, 26 April 2023 at 12:47 US/Pacific, Regional Spanner’s quorum was restored, which then allowed IAM and the region's control planes to begin recovery. We are currently conducting a detailed per-region audit (and conducting any required remediation if needed) of our internal regional Spanner allocations to confirm all regions fully meet Google Cloud expectations for fault isolation to prevent this issue in the future.\n### IAM\nRegional IAM needed regional Spanner available for it to serve and process requests. After regional Spanner was brought back to service, we kept the Cloud IAM in this region offline while it sync’d to get up to date with the global view of Cloud IAM. Most customers’ policies enforced by IAM are global in nature spanning identities, folders, and projects. These policies had received no updates for 13 hours in this region and any security critical updates made by customers during this period would not be available there if we had brought it online without syncing. For example, if a user was taken out of a critical IAM role for a storage bucket, the IAM server in the region would not yet know about it. Out of an abundance of caution, and treating our customers’ security as paramount, we decided to not serve traffic for IAM in europe-west9 until it completed full synchronization, and began serving traffic with up-to-date policies at 14:42 US/Pacific.\nTo address this recovery delay, we are implementing changes to our IAM policy refresh mechanism to ensure any stale policies (as a result of outages) are synchronized and resolved in less than 15 minutes. We are achieving this by providing improvements in replicating policies and parallelizing the synchronization when recovery is needed.\n### Google Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD)\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD) experienced regional impact in both the data plane (GCE VMs, PD Volumes) and control plane systems. Both systems had extended recovery periods after Spanner and IAM were restored.\nRegional Persistent Disk (PD) replicates volumes across multiple zones. To ensure proper quorum, Regional PD maintains a lease for each volume in a regional Spanner database. No Regional PD volumes had both replicas in the same building within the region. However, 79% of regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west9 region had one replica in the impacted building. When Spanner was offline in the region, these volumes could not establish quorum, and therefore became read-only as a failsafe measure. If Regional Spanner had not gone offline, Regional Persistent Disk (PD) would have ensured that the Regional PD volumes with one replica would work as expected (as detailed in the RePD documentation[2]) to enable customer workloads to continue operating in the available zone.\nSpanner and IAM were online by 26 April 2023 at 14:42 US/Pacific. Excluding the 58% of GCE VMs in europe-west9-a directly impacted by the water leak, the VMs and PDs in europe-west9-a were online by 19:00 US/Pacific. This time was to validate Persistent Disk integrity, to ensure that all volumes were ready for production operations before customer VMs were restarted, and then re-enable persistent disk operations. This took longer than expected due to a suspected issue with the PD health check verifier that reported errors. These were false positives due to an issue in starting up this many PDs at once. As soon as the team confirmed that the PD volumes were healthy we initiated the recovery process.\nTo ensure we don’t have these additional delays for PD in the future we are:\n1. Updating the PD startup process to eliminate the false positive errors.\n2. Parallelizing the PD start up process to allow it to complete faster.\n3. Improving configuration rollout time across the fleet used in this type of recovery.\nThe GCE control plane experienced a regional impact due to a dependence on regional Spanner. After regional Spanner recovered, the recovery time of the GCE control plane was extended due to the time required to revert service configuration changes that were made as part of the initial mitigation of global control plane impact. During the incident, the GCE control plane experienced some fanout API issues. To mitigate this impact, the GCE control plane was reconfigured on 26 April 2023 at 03:38 US/Pacific to remove the europe-west9 region and zones. When the IAM service was restored, this configuration change was reverted. Restoring europe-west9 to the set of active GCE regions required two sequential configuration changes. Google Cloud configuration changes of this nature are deployed gradually with an incremental rollout. The first configuration change started at 14:53 US/Pacific and completed at 15:33 US/Pacific. The second configuration change, which brought the europe-west9 region and zones back online, started at 15:46 US/Pacific and finished with the last zone at 19:00 US/Pacific. At this point the GCE control plane was fully operational.\nTo improve the mitigation and recovery time in the future GCE will:\n* Improve the testing process of removing and restoring a GCE control plane for a zonal and regional issue.\n* Ensure that API methods which require access to all regions and zones degrade gracefully when a control plane scope is unavailable.\n* Ensure that the Cloud Console continues to operate when a control plane scope is unavailable.\n[2] - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#repds\n### Enhanced Zonal \u0026 Regional Failure Testing\nWe are adding improvements to our zonal and regional environment to test for and ensure system behavior is as intended across all services in the case of zonal and regional outages. This includes validating that critical services consistently meet our expectations for how they allocate resources within our physical failure domains, that automated verification tests are in place to ensure no regressions, and ensure recovery times are efficient.\n## Global Google Cloud Impact and Restoration\nCloud Console provides a global view of Google Cloud resources. Certain Cloud Console pages rely on GCE backend APIs to perform global aggregated fanout across the regions. Some of these APIs failed to operate correctly while europe-west-9 was unavailable, rather than returning partial data. The global impact that was observed due to fanout issues in the Google Cloud Console control plane was mitigated by removing the europe-west9 control plane from the set of visible regions on Wednesday, 26 April 2023 at 03:38 US/Pacific. We are updating the Cloud Console so that fanout API methods continue to operate as expected to prevent this issue from occuring again. In addition, we are performing an audit (and any required remediation) across our services for any instances of fanout methods that could have similar issues.\nGCE provides an Internal DNS [3] feature to enable customers to look up instance names within their project. This service can be configured to either register instance names in a single Global namespace or in multiple Zonal namespaces. During the outage, customers using the Global namespace for Internal DNS for VM creation were unable to complete if the project had VMs in europe-west9, since it requires coordination with all zones where the project has resources to avoid duplicate instance DNS names. Customers using Zonal namespace for Internal DNS did not experience this impact. It is recommended to use Internal DNS with Zonal namespaces for your project (please see the documentation [3] for details).\n[3] - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns\n## Mitigation \u0026 Prevention of Additional Services\nAfter Regional Spanner, IAM and GCE/PD came back online for the region, almost all of the services in the region fully recovered soon after that. The following services either took longer to recover or had additional impact during the outage.\n- Google Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud SQL, Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud Dataflow\nPlease log a case with our Support team if you would like to receive additional information regarding these services.\nWe thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the outage and completing our investigation. We apologize to our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage.

Google Cloud Networking experienced intermittent network connectivity issues with Virtual Machines (VMs) and intra-zone packet loss from 08:44 to 08:48 a.m. US/Pacific. We sincerely apologize to our Google Cloud customers who were impacted during this disruption.\n## Root Cause\nDuring the decommissioning process in one of our data centers, three racks were inadvertently disconnected from their power supplies due to a rack labeling error. These racks hosted the data center network controller applications, so their failure impacted network control plane connectivity and resulted in network traffic falling back to static routing. The failover worked as expected, however, one component of a single networking device handled the backup static routes incorrectly, causing low level packet loss for a small subset of customers. Once power to the control plane was restored, network reconvergence caused up to four minutes of intra-zone network packet loss.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nOn Tuesday, 25 April 2023 at 07:03 a.m. US/Pacific, Google engineers were alerted to an issue via internal monitoring impacting the network controller with intermittent packet loss and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, the operations team was notified and power was restored to the racks.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Audit all rack labels and resolve any discrepancies\n* Train the technicians who are responsible for decommissioning on how to prevent recurrence\n* Implement additional defense mechanisms against traffic impact during cold restart of the network control plane\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.

Preliminary analysis showed a recent network configuration change caused the issue.\n**Customer Impact:**\nDuring the incident the following GCE actions failed:\n* Any activity that reuses an existing health check, including Instance Groups, and directs it to a new/different Virtual Machine instance.\n* Altering an existing health check.\n* Calling `gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until --stable` on a newly created instance group with an existing health check would fail/timeout as the Instance Group Manager would likely not reach a stable state.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong (asia-east2)","id":"asia-east2"},{"title":"Tokyo

Preliminary analysis showed a recent network configuration change caused the issue.\n**Customer Impact:**\nDuring the incident the following GCE actions failed:\n* Any activity that reuses an existing health check, including Instance Groups, and directs it to a new/different Virtual Machine instance.\n* Altering an existing health check.\n* Calling `gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until --stable` on a newly created instance group with an existing health check would fail/timeout as the Instance Group Manager would likely not reach a stable state.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong (asia-east2)","id":"asia-east2"},{"title":"Tokyo

2023 at 03:30 US/Pacific and Monday, 03 April 2023 at 05:30 US/Pacific, BigQuery experienced three separate windows of elevated latency and unavailability errors (503, 500 errors) in the US multi-region for a total duration of 8 hours, 2 minutes. To our BigQuery customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nBigQuery’s API provides users the ability to send job requests as outlined in the [public documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs). Elevated latencies or elevated error rates on these API requests may lead to customers experiencing service unavailability. These job requests are received by job frontend servers which handles the initial processing and routing to BigQuery’s query processing engine. Each server processes these requests in a series of thread pools.\nThe issue was triggered by an unexpected surge of job insert API requests from a single workload in rapid succession. This surge led to excessive load on a small fraction of our metadata serving systems creating a hotspot. This caused increased latencies and backed up requests to read the metadata for the single workload. This, in turn, led to contention of the threadpool, which resulted in elevated latency and timeout failures for other API job requests hitting the affected job frontend servers.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were first alerted to the outage by internal monitoring on 01 April 2023 at 04:05 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. A single workload was identified as the trigger. While engineers continued to work on identifying the cause and mitigation, the latency subsided, mitigating the issue automatically. After mitigation, our engineers continued investigations to understand the connection between the single workload and the broader impact.\nDuring ongoing investigations, engineers were alerted to a recurrence of the issue on 02 April 2023 at 03:05 US/Pacific. The issue was further escalated, and engineering added CPU resources to the problematic server. This was completed around the same time as when the single workload ended, thereby mitigating the issue. After further monitoring, engineers concluded investigations as the added resources helped mitigate the issue.\nOn 03 April 2023 at 01:34 US/Pacific time, our engineers were alerted to a reappearance of the issue. The engineering team identified and successfully stopped the type of workload that was causing the issue, effectively mitigating the problem. The team has taken additional steps to block that specific workload in the future.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Continue to block the problematic workload until we implement additional safeguards for it to run without causing broader impact.\n* Improve API execution by introducing isolation between the threadpools that process different job API calls and by introducing limits on the instantaneous threadpool capacity that can be used by a single workload.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 01 April 2023 between 03:30 and 05:14 US/Pacific, on 02 April 2023 between 03:00 and 05:08, and on 03 April 2023 between 01:20 and 05:30 :\n**BigQuery:**\nAffected customers in multi-region US experienced elevated latency and unavailability errors (503, 500 errors) when using the jobs API to insert a query job, get information about a job, cancel a job, or get back query results.\n----------------------------","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"}]},{"created":"2023-04-04T20:17:16+00:00","modified":"2023-04-10T16:40:40+00:00","when":"2023-04-04T20:17:16+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

The incident spanned between 1 April 2023 03:30 and 3 April 2023 05:30 for a cumulative duration of 7 hours, 47 minutes. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was triggered by an unexpected surge of job API requests from a single workload. The issue was mitigated once Google engineers identified and isolated the problematic workload.\nGoogle will complete a detailed Incident Report in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Affected customers experienced elevated latency and unavailability errors (503, 500 errors) while using the jobs API to insert a query job, get information about a job,

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 16 March 2023 12:50\n**Incident End:** 19 March, 2023 09:24\n**Duration:** 2 days, 20 hours, 34 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking - Google Cloud Load Balancing\n**Regions/Zones:**\n* us-east4\n* us-east1\n* us-east5\n**Description:**\nGoogle Front End (GFE) tasks in us-east4 were overloaded causing some traffic to be redirected to other regions including us-east1 and us-east5, which in turn caused higher than normal latency and errors for a duration of 2 days, 20 hours, 34 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause was due to an unexpected increase in traffic. Our engineering team is working to increase capacity in the us-east region to prevent a recurrence which is expected to complete by 21 March 2023.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Cloud Load Balancer traffic in affected regions experienced higher latency and possible elevated error rates during peak usage over the last few days (~05:00 to ~19:00 US/Pacific).\n**Additional details:**\n* There were no workarounds for customers who were required to host in us-east regions during the incident.\n* For customers who could move their backends to other regions (e.g. into us-west, europe and asia) this could have been a valid mitigation for them.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Northern Virginia (us-east4)","id":"us-east4"}]},{"created":"2023-03-20T11:46:21+00:00","modified":"2023-03-20T11:46:27+00:00","when":"2023-03-20T11:46:21+00:00","text":"The issue with Cloud Load Balancing has been resolved for all affected users as of Monday, 2023-03-20 04:46 US/Pacific.\nWe thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the issue.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Northern Virginia (us-east4)","id":"us-east4"}]},{"created":"2023-03-20T10:47:24+00:00","modified":"2023-03-20T10:47:36+00:00","when":"2023-03-20T10:47:24+00:00","text":"Summary: Google Engineers are investigating high latency and elevated errors in US-East.\nDescription: Our engineering team continues to work on the mitigation of the issue.\nWe do not have an ETA for mitigation at this point.\nWe will provide more information by Monday, 2023-03-20 06:00 US/Pacific.\nDiagnosis: Higher latency and possibly elevated errors on customers' global L7 Load Balancers during US peak hours (~05:00 to ~19:00)\nWorkaround: Customers who are able to move their backends to regions away from us-east.

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 16 March 2023 12:50\n**Incident End:** 19 March, 2023 09:24\n**Duration:** 2 days, 20 hours, 34 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking - Google Cloud Load Balancing\n**Regions/Zones:**\n* us-east4\n* us-east1\n* us-east5\n**Description:**\nGoogle Front End (GFE) tasks in us-east4 were overloaded causing some traffic to be redirected to other regions including us-east1 and us-east5, which in turn caused higher than normal latency and errors for a duration of 2 days, 20 hours, 34 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause was due to an unexpected increase in traffic. Our engineering team is working to increase capacity in the us-east region to prevent a recurrence which is expected to complete by 21 March 2023.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Cloud Load Balancer traffic in affected regions experienced higher latency and possible elevated error rates during peak usage over the last few days (~05:00 to ~19:00 US/Pacific).\n**Additional details:**\n* There were no workarounds for customers who were required to host in us-east regions during the incident.\n* For customers who could move their backends to other regions (e.g. into us-west, europe and asia) this could have been a valid mitigation for them.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Northern Virginia (us-east4)","id":"us-east4"}]},"status_impact":"SERVICE_DISRUPTION","severity":"medium","service_key":"zall","service_name":"Multiple Products","affected_products":[{"title":"Google Cloud Networking","id":"VNJxzcH58QmTt5H6pnT6"},{"title":"Cloud Load Balancing","id":"ix7u9beT8ivBdjApTif3"}],"uri":"incidents/bhM8RvvupuzK36xUpx5Q","currently_affected_locations":[],"previously_affected_locations":[{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Northern Virginia (us-east4)","id":"us-east4"}]},{"id":"Cjw6iVXNzcGCMekNFmNm","number":"9948649004642627381","begin":"2023-03-15T19:19:34+00:00","created":"2023-03-15T19:34:00+00:00","end":"2023-03-15T20:24:54+00:00","modified":"2023-03-15T20:24:55+00:00","external_desc":"Chronicle Security customers may experience errors when trying to perform certain operations","updates":[{"created":"2023-03-15T20:24:53+00:00","modified":"2023-03-15T20:24:55+00:00","when":"2023-03-15T20:24:53+00:00","text":"The issue with Chronicle Security has been resolved for all affected users as of Wednesday, 2023-03-15 13:22 US/Pacific.

Report\n## Summary\nOn Thursday, 9 March 2023, Cloud Armor experienced a service outage in the asia-southeast1 region for a duration of 49 minutes. To our Cloud Armor customers whose services were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Armor allows Google Cloud (GCP) customers to configure Web Application Firewall (WAF) and other application-level filtering policies to protect their applications and services exposed to the Internet via external HTTP(S) load balancers and TCP/SSL proxies. For every incoming request, Cloud Armor evaluates the user-configured security policy before it is proxied back to the customer backend. In order to evaluate the policy, Cloud Armor makes complex and computationally intensive evaluations based on customer supplied configurations at the edge of Google’s network. Policies can be changed by customers at any time, and changes propagate within minutes.\nOn Thursday, 9 March 2023 at 01:35 US/Pacific, a specific configuration was applied which, when combined with incoming traffic patterns, triggered a latent bug that resulted in a failure of Cloud Armor services in the asia-southeast1 region.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring systems on 9 March 2023 at 01:43 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. At 02:16 US/Pacific, engineers identified a single customer configuration as the likely cause of the issue. At 02:20 US/Pacific, engineers removed and locked the configuration at which time the service began to recover. The service fully recovered by 02:24 US/Pacific on 9 March 2023.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for any potential impact to your organization. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n* A fix for the latent bug has been deployed to production as of Friday, 17 March 2023.\n* More robust configuration validations and run time checks are being put in place, including manual testing and automated unit tests.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 9 March 2023 from 01:35 to 02:24 US/Pacific, approximately 50% of Cloud Armor customer security policies would not have been applied for projects in the asia-southeast1 region.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[]},{"created":"2023-03-10T01:23:41+00:00","modified":"2023-03-10T01:23:41+00:00","when":"2023-03-10T01:23:41+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, February 27, 2023, Google Cloud Networking’s production network experienced significant packet loss starting 04:58 US/Pacific for a duration of up to seven minutes. This caused errors and failures in several downstream Google Cloud and Google Workspace services that took up to an additional six minutes to recover. To our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle’s production network has several levels of redundancy and several systems to ensure optimal bandwidth routing. One of our back end control plane elements responsible for calculating optimal paths for bandwidth, consumes snapshot data from a critical element that provides detailed network modeling, including topology, statistics, and forwarding table information. During a routine update to the critical elements snapshot data, an incomplete snapshot was inadvertently shared which removed several sites from the topology map. This caused traffic originating from those sites to be discarded until recovery mechanisms kicked in and correctly reprogrammed all paths. The packet loss caused errors and failures in multiple downstream Google Cloud and Google Workspace services.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle's automation systems mitigated this failure by pushing a complete topology snapshot during the next programming cycle. The proper sites were restored and the network converged by 05:05 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing this type of disruption from reoccurring and is taking the following actions:\n- Input validation in the control plane has been fully activated for the most critical components and is rolling out to remaining components. The bandwidth routing system is now more robust to accommodate unexpectedly large changes in the topology\n- Deploy a fix to the topology system to prevent this cause of incomplete snapshots.\n- The system providing topology input to the control plane will be sharded not to span multiple regions. This will ensure that an erroneous input, if any, will not impact traffic originating from many regions at the same time.\n- Safer sequencing when removing sites from the topology map\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday, 27 February 2023, from 04:58 to 05:12 US/Pacific unless otherwise noted:\n### Google Cloud Platform Services:\n**Apigee:**\nUp to 20% of requests in affected regions experienced timeouts and elevated 5xx error rates in southamerica-east1, us-east1 and us-central1.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\nAffected customers/users experienced increased packet loss for cross region traffic between affected regions: asia-east1, asia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west1, europe-west4, us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west4\n**Cloud Interconnect:**\nAffected customers/users in regions us-east4, asia-southeast1, southamerica-east1, us-east7, us-west4 experienced increased packet loss on their interconnects.\n**BigQuery:**\nAffected customers/users running queries in affected BigQuery regions experienced increased latency and elevated UNAVAILABLE error rates (retriable 503 errors) between 04:58 and 05:10. Regions affected were: aws-us-east-1, azure-eastus2, southamerica-east1, us-multiregion, us-east4, us-east5, us-east7, us-south1.\n**Cloud Dataflow:**\nOverall two regions were impacted: us-central1 and us-east4. ~20% of Dataflow jobs in us-central1 experienced streaming data disruption: no data passed through the Dataflow pipelines for about 13 minutes. No visible impact in us-central1 for Dataflow Batch jobs. For us-east4 the impact was on 55% of Dataflow Streaming jobs and 75% of Dataflow Batch jobs, for about 13 minutes.\n**Cloud Bigtable:**\nAffected customers/users in us-central1, us-east4, and us-west1 experienced unavailable errors (retriable 503 errors) or deadline exceeded (504 errors). 11.3% of customer projects were affected by the issue.\n**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS):**\nAffected customers/users in us-east4, us-east5, us-central1, multi-region us, multi-region nam7, and global experienced reduced availability in the form of retriable 503 (unavailable) and 504 (deadline exceeded) errors across two categories of KMS keys: software and hardware keys. For software keys, 2.4% of customers were affected, across all the regions mentioned above. For hardware keys, the impact was limited to the regions: us-central1, multi-region us and global where 0.7% of customers were affected. During the outage, 0.1% of software requests returned 503 and 504 errors and 0.78% of hardware requests returned 503 and 504 errors. Requests which were not able to reach our servers likely got 503 (unavailable) which means they have retried and eventually succeeded or got a 504 (deadline exceeded) error.\n**Cloud Monitoring:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated latency on Cloud Monitoring dashboards. Customers writing metric data through the Monitoring API experienced elevated error rates.\n**Persistent Disk:**\nAffected customers/users would have seen read, writes, and unmaps stuck. Approximately 0.12% of devices were affected globally. Affected regions were: us-central1, us-east4, southamerica-east1, us-west4, asia-southeast1.\n**Cloud SQL:**\nAffected customers/users may have seen intermittent connectivity issues for ~10 minutes from 05:00-05:10 US/Pacific (us-central1, us-east4, us-west4, southamerica-east1). Retrying should have succeeded, as the success rate was ~80-95% depending on region and method.\n**Cloud Workflows:**\n~1% of (global) requests to the workflow executions API failed. 75% of requests failed in us-west4. 46% of requests failed in us-east4. ~3.5% of requests failed in us-central1. ~2.5% of requests failed in southamerica-east1 and northamerica-northeast2.\n**Cloud Console:**\nAffected customers/users experienced an elevated number of GUI failures. Up to 9% of page views were affected during impact period..\n**Cloud Load Balancing:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated 500 error rates from load balancers for traffic passing through asia-southeast1, us-central1, us-west4.\n**Google Compute Engine:** Affected customers/users experienced elevated 500 error rates when sending HTTP requests to Google Compute Engine APIs. This would also include timeouts when reading or writing GCE metadata guest attributes. Additionally, affected users would have experienced an increase in latency and elevated UNAVAILABLE error rates (retriable 503 errors) between 05:00 am PST and 05:10 am PST for Compute Engine Frontend UI pages.\n**Cloud Run:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases..\n**Cloud App Engine:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases. .\n**Cloud Functions:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases.\n**Cloud VPN:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated packet loss in us-east4, asia-southeast1, southamerica-east1, us-east7, us-west4.\n**Identity and Access Management:**\nAffected customers/users experienced NOT_FOUND, PERMISSION_DENIED, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED and UNAVAILABLE errors.\n**Cloud Pub/Sub:**\nAffected customers/users experienced unavailability and increased latency for Publish operations, with the most severe impact occurring in us-east1, us-east4, and us-east5, where approximately 40% of projects experienced at least one minute in which fewer than 99% of requests succeeded. In most regions, \u003c10% of projects experienced impact. Availability of subscribe operations was also impacted in a similar pattern. In combination with inability of the system to move message data between locations as normal, this led to increased end-to-end message delivery latency for approximately 20% of subscriptions.\n**Google Cloud Storage:**\nOn 2023-02-27, from 04:58 to 05:06 (8 minutes), some GCS customers/users in us-east4 experienced reduced availability in the form of Service Unavailable (retryable) errors at a rate of about 1% overall. Less than 1% of customer projects had an error rate of more than 1%. Some GCS customers in the configurations us-multiregion, us-central1 and us-east1 also experienced an elevated error rate during the impact window that did not exceed 1%.\n**Cloud Firestore:**\nAffected customers/users would have seen increased unavailability errors with Firestore and Datastore API in various regions, including southamerica-east1, us-west4, us-east4, us-east1 and nam5. Globally, around 33% of active customers and 0.38% of active requests received 502 unavailable errors or increased latency between 4:58 and 5:10 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Data Loss Prevention:**\nNo user impact\n**Cloud Memorystore:** * ***Control Plane:*** Between 4:58 and 5:09 US/Pacific, some customers/users issuing control plane requests (like GetInstance, CreateInstance, etc) experienced a significant increase in latency, and, in ~35% of the cases, - request failures with 5xx error code. The issue was most pronounced in us-east4, us-west4, us-east1, and asia-southeast1 cloud regions, but was noticeable in other regions as well. * ***Data plane:*** Between 5:00 and 5:04 US/Pacific, a number of instances in us-east4, us-west4, southamerica-east1, us-central1, and europe-west2 experienced 1-5 minutes of unavailability, where customers were unable to connect to their Redis server. In many STANDARD-tier instances, this resulted in a failover.\n**Cloud Spanner:**\nOn 2023-02-27, from 04:57 to 05:06 US/Pacific (9 minutes), some customers/users in us-east4, nam3, nam7, nam9, nam11, nam12, nam-eur-asia3 experienced reduced availability in the form of deadline exceeded (retryable) errors and also an increase in latency. Less than 1% of customer projects had an error rate of more than 1%.\n**Cloud Build:**\nCloud Build API customers/users in 2 regions (southamerica-east1 and prod-global) experienced high latency and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED responses. Availability SLO for {Get,List}WorkerPool in southamerica-east1 was down to 13% for 3 minutes and consumed 25% of the 30-day error budget. Availability SLO for ReceiveGitHubDotComWebhook was down to 28% for 3 minutes and consumed 9% of the 30-day error budget.\n**Container Registry:**\nContainer registry customers/users in the global region experienced high latency and HTTP 504 responses. Availability SLO for manifests_get consumed 6% of the 30-day error budget. Availability SLO for ping_and_token_availability consumed 15% of the 30-day error budget.\n**Cloud Tasks:**\nCloud Tasks customers/users in the us-central1 region experienced high latency and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED responses for CreateTasks requests.

Summary\nOn Monday, February 27, 2023, Google Cloud Networking’s production network experienced significant packet loss starting 04:58 US/Pacific for a duration of up to seven minutes. This caused errors and failures in several downstream Google Cloud and Google Workspace services that took up to an additional six minutes to recover. To our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle’s production network has several levels of redundancy and several systems to ensure optimal bandwidth routing. One of our back end control plane elements responsible for calculating optimal paths for bandwidth, consumes snapshot data from a critical element that provides detailed network modeling, including topology, statistics, and forwarding table information. During a routine update to the critical elements snapshot data, an incomplete snapshot was inadvertently shared which removed several sites from the topology map. This caused traffic originating from those sites to be discarded until recovery mechanisms kicked in and correctly reprogrammed all paths. The packet loss caused errors and failures in multiple downstream Google Cloud and Google Workspace services.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle's automation systems mitigated this failure by pushing a complete topology snapshot during the next programming cycle. The proper sites were restored and the network converged by 05:05 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing this type of disruption from reoccurring and is taking the following actions:\n- Input validation in the control plane has been fully activated for the most critical components and is rolling out to remaining components. The bandwidth routing system is now more robust to accommodate unexpectedly large changes in the topology\n- Deploy a fix to the topology system to prevent this cause of incomplete snapshots.\n- The system providing topology input to the control plane will be sharded not to span multiple regions. This will ensure that an erroneous input, if any, will not impact traffic originating from many regions at the same time.\n- Safer sequencing when removing sites from the topology map\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday, 27 February 2023, from 04:58 to 05:12 US/Pacific unless otherwise noted:\n### Google Cloud Platform Services:\n**Apigee:**\nUp to 20% of requests in affected regions experienced timeouts and elevated 5xx error rates in southamerica-east1, us-east1 and us-central1.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\nAffected customers/users experienced increased packet loss for cross region traffic between affected regions: asia-east1, asia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west1, europe-west4, us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west4\n**Cloud Interconnect:**\nAffected customers/users in regions us-east4, asia-southeast1, southamerica-east1, us-east7, us-west4 experienced increased packet loss on their interconnects.\n**BigQuery:**\nAffected customers/users running queries in affected BigQuery regions experienced increased latency and elevated UNAVAILABLE error rates (retriable 503 errors) between 04:58 and 05:10. Regions affected were: aws-us-east-1, azure-eastus2, southamerica-east1, us-multiregion, us-east4, us-east5, us-east7, us-south1.\n**Cloud Dataflow:**\nOverall two regions were impacted: us-central1 and us-east4. ~20% of Dataflow jobs in us-central1 experienced streaming data disruption: no data passed through the Dataflow pipelines for about 13 minutes. No visible impact in us-central1 for Dataflow Batch jobs. For us-east4 the impact was on 55% of Dataflow Streaming jobs and 75% of Dataflow Batch jobs, for about 13 minutes.\n**Cloud Bigtable:**\nAffected customers/users in us-central1, us-east4, and us-west1 experienced unavailable errors (retriable 503 errors) or deadline exceeded (504 errors). 11.3% of customer projects were affected by the issue.\n**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS):**\nAffected customers/users in us-east4, us-east5, us-central1, multi-region us, multi-region nam7, and global experienced reduced availability in the form of retriable 503 (unavailable) and 504 (deadline exceeded) errors across two categories of KMS keys: software and hardware keys. For software keys, 2.4% of customers were affected, across all the regions mentioned above. For hardware keys, the impact was limited to the regions: us-central1, multi-region us and global where 0.7% of customers were affected. During the outage, 0.1% of software requests returned 503 and 504 errors and 0.78% of hardware requests returned 503 and 504 errors. Requests which were not able to reach our servers likely got 503 (unavailable) which means they have retried and eventually succeeded or got a 504 (deadline exceeded) error.\n**Cloud Monitoring:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated latency on Cloud Monitoring dashboards. Customers writing metric data through the Monitoring API experienced elevated error rates.\n**Persistent Disk:**\nAffected customers/users would have seen read, writes, and unmaps stuck. Approximately 0.12% of devices were affected globally. Affected regions were: us-central1, us-east4, southamerica-east1, us-west4, asia-southeast1.\n**Cloud SQL:**\nAffected customers/users may have seen intermittent connectivity issues for ~10 minutes from 05:00-05:10 US/Pacific (us-central1, us-east4, us-west4, southamerica-east1). Retrying should have succeeded, as the success rate was ~80-95% depending on region and method.\n**Cloud Workflows:**\n~1% of (global) requests to the workflow executions API failed. 75% of requests failed in us-west4. 46% of requests failed in us-east4. ~3.5% of requests failed in us-central1. ~2.5% of requests failed in southamerica-east1 and northamerica-northeast2.\n**Cloud Console:**\nAffected customers/users experienced an elevated number of GUI failures. Up to 9% of page views were affected during impact period..\n**Cloud Load Balancing:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated 500 error rates from load balancers for traffic passing through asia-southeast1, us-central1, us-west4.\n**Google Compute Engine:** Affected customers/users experienced elevated 500 error rates when sending HTTP requests to Google Compute Engine APIs. This would also include timeouts when reading or writing GCE metadata guest attributes. Additionally, affected users would have experienced an increase in latency and elevated UNAVAILABLE error rates (retriable 503 errors) between 05:00 am PST and 05:10 am PST for Compute Engine Frontend UI pages.\n**Cloud Run:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases..\n**Cloud App Engine:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases. .\n**Cloud Functions:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases.\n**Cloud VPN:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated packet loss in us-east4, asia-southeast1, southamerica-east1, us-east7, us-west4.\n**Identity and Access Management:**\nAffected customers/users experienced NOT_FOUND, PERMISSION_DENIED, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED and UNAVAILABLE errors.\n**Cloud Pub/Sub:**\nAffected customers/users experienced unavailability and increased latency for Publish operations, with the most severe impact occurring in us-east1, us-east4, and us-east5, where approximately 40% of projects experienced at least one minute in which fewer than 99% of requests succeeded. In most regions, \u003c10% of projects experienced impact. Availability of subscribe operations was also impacted in a similar pattern. In combination with inability of the system to move message data between locations as normal, this led to increased end-to-end message delivery latency for approximately 20% of subscriptions.\n**Google Cloud Storage:**\nOn 2023-02-27, from 04:58 to 05:06 (8 minutes), some GCS customers/users in us-east4 experienced reduced availability in the form of Service Unavailable (retryable) errors at a rate of about 1% overall.

Customers directly using IAM were not affected. The root cause was related to a configuration change with unintended consequences, which was immediately rolled back, once identified as the problem, thereby restoring services.\n**Customer Impact:**\nArtifact Registry\n- Affected customers would not have been able to create new repositories in the Asia multi-region. Customers would have received a failure message of “Request contains an invalid argument.”\nGoogle Cloud Composer\n- Affected customers in the Asia multi-region were not able to create Composer environments, receiving errors indicating either an issue with AppEngine or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster creation.\nGoogle Cloud Storage\n- Affected customers would have experienced increased error rates when creating buckets in the Asia multi-region.

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 09 December 2022 04:50\n**Incident End:** 09 December 2022 07:55\n**Duration:** 3 hours, 5 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Artifact Registry: New repository creations\n- Google Cloud Composer: Composer environment creations\n- Google Cloud Storage: Operations that check IAM policies, especially CreateBucket\n- Google Kubernetes Engine: New cluster creation\n- Identity and Access Management: Not directly affected, only downstream services.\n**Regions/Zones:** australia-southeast1, asia-east1, asia-east2, asia-northeast1, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-south1, asia-south2, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast2, and asia (Google Cloud multi-region).\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) in the Asia multi-region experienced unavailability, which impacted several downstream Google Cloud services for a period of 3 hours and 17 minutes. Customers directly using IAM were not affected. The root cause was related to a configuration change with unintended consequences, which was immediately rolled back, once identified as the problem, thereby restoring services.\n**Customer Impact:**\nArtifact Registry\n- Affected customers would not have been able to create new repositories in the Asia multi-region. Customers would have received a failure message of “Request contains an invalid argument.”\nGoogle Cloud Composer\n- Affected customers in the Asia multi-region were not able to create Composer environments, receiving errors indicating either an issue with AppEngine or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster creation.\nGoogle Cloud Storage\n- Affected customers would have experienced increased error rates when creating buckets in the Asia multi-region. GKE uses Google Cloud multi-regional buckets internally, so regional GKE customers throughout Asia Pacific were affected.\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine\n- Affected customers would have been unable to create new clusters in the affected regions.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong

17:30 PT, Google Compute Engine (GCE) customers experienced issues connecting to instances via Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) through Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) [1] for a total duration of 22 hours and 46 minutes. To our GCE customers whose instances were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap\n## Background\nIAP assists in securing user access to registered web applications and cloud resources by providing centralized access control. IAP is the default method of connectivity when customers SSH through the Google Cloud Console or `gcloud` tool to GCE instances which do not have external IP addresses. The IAP connection method also can be specified by organization policy or `gcloud` invocation flags.\n## Root Cause\nBefore allowing a connection through SSH, IAP validates the user and connects to a backend system database. That database is used to collect instance and networking information for GCE instances for validation that the instance exists. This database is updated in real-time, as GCE instances are added, changed, or removed.\nDue to an issue with a global index associated with this backend system database, writes to the database were unable to keep up with instance updates from GCE and eventually caused the updates of GCE IAP information to lag. This meant that as new GCE instances were created, they were not being added to the database that IAP accessed. Therefore, IAP was unaware of the GCE instances and thus denied access to them when customers attempted to use SSH through the IAP Proxy.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were initially notified of the issue through a support case on 1 December 2022 at 22:44 PT and immediately started an investigation. At 01:55 PT on 2 December, engineers determined the problem to be an internal system backend database used for instance and networking information for GCE, and the issue was escalated to our database team. Database engineers attempted several mitigations starting at 03:01 PT but experienced limited success.\nAt 11:01 PT, engineers redirected IAP traffic to a standby replica of the system database, which temporarily mitigated the issue at 13:38 PT. At 17:45 PT, the issue recurred, as an existing rollout mistakenly redirected traffic back to the primary database, overriding the non-standard configuration being used to mitigate the issue at the time. Engineers again redirected traffic to the database replica, which fully mitigated and resolved the issue at 20:50 PT.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n1. Make modifications to our alerting practices for IAP SSH to closely monitor the backlog of unprocessed instance creations and updates, enabling us to take corrective actions to mitigate any customer impact.\n2. Refactor our rollout vehicles to provide more fine-grained change deployment, so that unrelated configuration changes do not also deploy core service configuration or binaries for the IAP infrastructure. This will prevent the secondary issue recurrence, which occurred at 17:45 PT.\n3. Improve the performance of concurrent reads and writes to the same database rows by applying exclusive locks, which will serialize those transactions. This will effectively help eliminate transactions from becoming deadlocked and rejected.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 1 December 2022 from 17:30 PT to 2 December 2022 13:11 PT and again from 17:45 PT to 20:50 PT, GCE customers experienced issues connecting to instances via SSH through IAP.\nCustomers attempting to connect to GCE instances created or updated after 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT using SSH through IAP would have experienced connection failures with “ERROR: (gcloud.compute.start-iap-tunnel) Error while connecting [4047: 'Failed to lookup instance'].”\nThis issue only impacted SSH access, and workloads continued to run correctly.

Summary\nOn 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT, Google Compute Engine (GCE) customers experienced issues connecting to instances via Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) through Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) [1] for a total duration of 22 hours and 46 minutes. To our GCE customers whose instances were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap\n## Background\nIAP assists in securing user access to registered web applications and cloud resources by providing centralized access control. IAP is the default method of connectivity when customers SSH through the Google Cloud Console or `gcloud` tool to GCE instances which do not have external IP addresses. The IAP connection method also can be specified by organization policy or `gcloud` invocation flags.\n## Root Cause\nBefore allowing a connection through SSH, IAP validates the user and connects to a backend system database. That database is used to collect instance and networking information for GCE instances for validation that the instance exists. This database is updated in real-time, as GCE instances are added, changed, or removed.\nDue to an issue with a global index associated with this backend system database, writes to the database were unable to keep up with instance updates from GCE and eventually caused the updates of GCE IAP information to lag. This meant that as new GCE instances were created, they were not being added to the database that IAP accessed. Therefore, IAP was unaware of the GCE instances and thus denied access to them when customers attempted to use SSH through the IAP Proxy.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were initially notified of the issue through a support case on 1 December 2022 at 22:44 PT and immediately started an investigation. At 01:55 PT on 2 December, engineers determined the problem to be an internal system backend database used for instance and networking information for GCE, and the issue was escalated to our database team. Database engineers attempted several mitigations starting at 03:01 PT but experienced limited success.\nAt 11:01 PT, engineers redirected IAP traffic to a standby replica of the system database, which temporarily mitigated the issue at 13:38 PT. At 17:45 PT, the issue recurred, as an existing rollout mistakenly redirected traffic back to the primary database, overriding the non-standard configuration being used to mitigate the issue at the time. Engineers again redirected traffic to the database replica, which fully mitigated and resolved the issue at 20:50 PT.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n1. Make modifications to our alerting practices for IAP SSH to closely monitor the backlog of unprocessed instance creations and updates, enabling us to take corrective actions to mitigate any customer impact.\n2. Refactor our rollout vehicles to provide more fine-grained change deployment, so that unrelated configuration changes do not also deploy core service configuration or binaries for the IAP infrastructure. This will prevent the secondary issue recurrence, which occurred at 17:45 PT.\n3. Improve the performance of concurrent reads and writes to the same database rows by applying exclusive locks, which will serialize those transactions. This will effectively help eliminate transactions from becoming deadlocked and rejected.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 1 December 2022 from 17:30 PT to 2 December 2022 13:11 PT and again from 17:45 PT to 20:50 PT, GCE customers experienced issues connecting to instances via SSH through IAP.\nCustomers attempting to connect to GCE instances created or updated after 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT using SSH through IAP would have experienced connection failures with “ERROR: (gcloud.compute.start-iap-tunnel) Error while connecting [4047: 'Failed to lookup instance'].”\nThis issue only impacted SSH access, and workloads continued to run correctly. Additionally, connections without IAP and connection to instances that were not modified after 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT would not have been affected.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong (asia-east2)","id":"asia-east2"},{"title":"Tokyo (asia-northeast1)","id":"asia-northeast1"},{"title":"Osaka (asia-northeast2)","id":"asia-northeast2"},{"title":"Seoul (asia-northeast3)","id":"asia-northeast3"},{"title":"Mumbai (asia-south1)","id":"asia-south1"},{"title":"Delhi (asia-south2)","id":"asia-south2"},{"title":"Singapore (asia-southeast1)","id":"asia-southeast1"},{"title":"Jakarta (asia-southeast2)","id":"asia-southeast2"},{"title":"Sydney (australia-southeast1)","id":"australia-southeast1"},{"title":"Melbourne (australia-southeast2)","id":"australia-southeast2"},{"title":"Warsaw (europe-central2)","id":"europe-central2"},{"title":"Finland (europe-north1)","id":"europe-north1"},{"title":"Madrid (europe-southwest1)","id":"europe-southwest1"},{"title":"Belgium (europe-west1)","id":"europe-west1"},{"title":"London (europe-west2)","id":"europe-west2"},{"title":"Frankfurt (europe-west3)","id":"europe-west3"},{"title":"Netherlands (europe-west4)","id":"europe-west4"},{"title":"Zurich (europe-west6)","id":"europe-west6"},{"title":"Milan (europe-west8)","id":"europe-west8"},{"title":"Paris (europe-west9)","id":"europe-west9"},{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"},{"title":"Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)","id":"northamerica-northeast2"},{"title":"São Paulo (southamerica-east1)","id":"southamerica-east1"},{"title":"Santiago (southamerica-west1)","id":"southamerica-west1"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"},{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Northern Virginia (us-east4)","id":"us-east4"},{"title":"Columbus (us-east5)","id":"us-east5"},{"title":"Dallas (us-south1)","id":"us-south1"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"},{"title":"Los Angeles (us-west2)","id":"us-west2"},{"title":"Salt Lake City (us-west3)","id":"us-west3"},{"title":"Las Vegas (us-west4)","id":"us-west4"}]},"status_impact":"SERVICE_OUTAGE","severity":"high","service_key":"L3ggmi3Jy4xJmgodFA9K","service_name":"Google Compute Engine","affected_products":[{"title":"Google Compute Engine","id":"L3ggmi3Jy4xJmgodFA9K"}],"uri":"incidents/UHoBgMgvvQKa18JQjdbs","currently_affected_locations":[],"previously_affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong (asia-east2)","id":"asia-east2"},{"title":"Tokyo (asia-northeast1)","id":"asia-northeast1"},{"title":"Osaka (asia-northeast2)","id":"asia-northeast2"},{"title":"Seoul (asia-northeast3)","id":"asia-northeast3"},{"title":"Mumbai (asia-south1)","id":"asia-south1"},{"title":"Delhi (asia-south2)","id":"asia-south2"},{"title":"Singapore (asia-southeast1)","id":"asia-southeast1"},{"title":"Jakarta (asia-southeast2)","id":"asia-southeast2"},{"title":"Sydney (australia-southeast1)","id":"australia-southeast1"},{"title":"Melbourne (australia-southeast2)","id":"australia-southeast2"},{"title":"Warsaw (europe-central2)","id":"europe-central2"},{"title":"Finland (europe-north1)","id":"europe-north1"},{"title":"Madrid (europe-southwest1)","id":"europe-southwest1"},{"title":"Belgium (europe-west1)","id":"europe-west1"},{"title":"London (europe-west2)","id":"europe-west2"},{"title":"Frankfurt (europe-west3)","id":"europe-west3"},{"title":"Netherlands (europe-west4)","id":"europe-west4"},{"title":"Zurich (europe-west6)","id":"europe-west6"},{"title":"Milan (europe-west8)","id":"europe-west8"},{"title":"Paris (europe-west9)","id":"europe-west9"},{"title":"Montréal (northamerica-northeast1)","id":"northamerica-northeast1"},{"title":"Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)","id":"northamerica-northeast2"},{"title":"São Paulo (southamerica-east1)","id":"southamerica-east1"},{"title":"Santiago (southamerica-west1)","id":"southamerica-west1"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"},{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Northern Virginia (us-east4)","id":"us-east4"},{"title":"Columbus (us-east5)","id":"us-east5"},{"title":"Dallas (us-south1)","id":"us-south1"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"},{"title":"Los Angeles (us-west2)","id":"us-west2"},{"title":"Salt Lake City (us-west3)","id":"us-west3"},{"title":"Las Vegas (us-west4)","id":"us-west4"}]},{"id":"qwswjQfmtWZ6XV8gryqE","number":"7163286282817763465","begin":"2022-12-01T20:20:00+00:00","created":"2022-12-01T21:20:42+00:00","end":"2022-12-01T21:36:00+00:00","modified":"2022-12-02T00:56:16+00:00","external_desc":"App Engine Flexible Create Update and Delete endpoints failing","updates":[{"created":"2022-12-02T00:55:38+00:00","modified":"2022-12-02T00:56:16+00:00","when":"2022-12-02T00:55:38+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

multiple Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services experienced elevated error rates affecting a small percentage of customers for a duration of 38 minutes and 48 minutes respectively. To our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Workspace services (for eligible customers) rely on Context-Aware Access [1] and GCP services rely on Access Context Manager [2]. These are a unified set of infrastructure services (henceforth referred to as \"Access Context Manager\") that are responsible for determining what access levels a request has based on the level of trust a company's security policy places in that request. The customer must enable Access Context Manager.\nOn 14 November at 09:25 PT, Google engineers were alerted to an issue in which some background tasks were experiencing resource exhaustion with Access Context Manager, which authorizes enhanced verification access for enterprise customers.\nDuring an initial attempt to resolve the issue, an inadvertent decrease in capacity for the service occurred. This caused authentication traffic to be directed to a small number of tasks, which were unable to handle the load. While internal safeguards successfully isolated the impact to a single data center, thus reducing the impact further, they were unable to stop the service tasks from repeatedly restarting or crashing. In the absence of access-level responses from the system, dependent Google Cloud and Google Workspace services acted correctly and fail-closed, as they are supposed to when they do not have a clear signal that access is permitted.\n- [1] https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380\n- [2] - https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/overview#:~:text=Access%20Context%20Manager%20allows%20Google,access%20levels%20and%20service%20perimeters\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers redirected traffic away from the affected Access Context Manager infrastructure at 11:19 PT and routed it to data centers that had available capacity to manage load. Service was restored by 11:28 PT for Workspace and 11:38 PT for Google Cloud.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Update Access Context Manager playbooks to include better information on baseline production task configurations to prevent decreasing capacity to unsafe levels and use commands that cannot mistake growing and shrinking.\n- Re-evaluate the review/approval process for Access Context Manager capacity changes to ensure that request reviewers have better visibility into the changes being requested to prevent unintentional reductions in capacity.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nGoogle Workspace Product Impact:\nA small number of users of the following Google Workspace products experienced HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors: Calendar, Tasks, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, Keep, Jamboard, and Chat between 10:50 PT to 11:28 PT. Consumer users were not affected.\n- Calendar, Tasks, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, Keep, Jamboard, Chat: Affected users experienced HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors.\n- Admin Console: Customers' admin consoles displayed generic logos, rather than company specific logos.\n- Groups: Groups User Interface and Settings API served HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors to all users.\nGoogle Cloud Product Impact :\nA small number of users of the following GCP may have experienced increased error rates and unavailability between 10:50 PT to 11:38 PT in the following regions.\n- Google Compute Engine: Affected customers experienced elevated API traffic error rates up to 6% in the following regions: asia-east2, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-northeast 1, asia-south1, asia-south2, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, europe-west9, and southamerica-east1.\n- Google Cloud Console: Approximately 3% of customers were affected, experiencing increased error rates of up to 0.5%.\n- Resource Manager: Affected customers may have seen elevated error rates up to 2.6% and seen generic status unavailable errors when using the API.\n- Google BigQuery: Affected customers experienced elevated API traffic error rates up to 10% when using the - BigQuery storage read and write APIs in southamerica-west1 and in the BigQuery US multi-region.\n- Cloud Firestore: Up to 7.5% of customer projects experienced elevated latency, operation deadline expirations, and/or error messages that state Policy Checks are unavailable. The impact was restricted to projects hosted in nam5 US multi-region, which includes us-central1.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Global","id":"global"}]},{"created":"2022-11-15T06:03:08+00:00","modified":"2022-11-15T15:07:53+00:00","when":"2022-11-15T06:03:08+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.

To our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Workspace services (for eligible customers) rely on Context-Aware Access [1] and GCP services rely on Access Context Manager [2]. These are a unified set of infrastructure services (henceforth referred to as \"Access Context Manager\") that are responsible for determining what access levels a request has based on the level of trust a company's security policy places in that request. The customer must enable Access Context Manager.\nOn 14 November at 09:25 PT, Google engineers were alerted to an issue in which some background tasks were experiencing resource exhaustion with Access Context Manager, which authorizes enhanced verification access for enterprise customers.\nDuring an initial attempt to resolve the issue, an inadvertent decrease in capacity for the service occurred. This caused authentication traffic to be directed to a small number of tasks, which were unable to handle the load. While internal safeguards successfully isolated the impact to a single data center, thus reducing the impact further, they were unable to stop the service tasks from repeatedly restarting or crashing. In the absence of access-level responses from the system, dependent Google Cloud and Google Workspace services acted correctly and fail-closed, as they are supposed to when they do not have a clear signal that access is permitted.\n- [1] https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380\n- [2] - https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/overview#:~:text=Access%20Context%20Manager%20allows%20Google,access%20levels%20and%20service%20perimeters\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers redirected traffic away from the affected Access Context Manager infrastructure at 11:19 PT and routed it to data centers that had available capacity to manage load. Service was restored by 11:28 PT for Workspace and 11:38 PT for Google Cloud.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Update Access Context Manager playbooks to include better information on baseline production task configurations to prevent decreasing capacity to unsafe levels and use commands that cannot mistake growing and shrinking.\n- Re-evaluate the review/approval process for Access Context Manager capacity changes to ensure that request reviewers have better visibility into the changes being requested to prevent unintentional reductions in capacity.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nGoogle Workspace Product Impact:\nA small number of users of the following Google Workspace products experienced HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors: Calendar, Tasks, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, Keep, Jamboard, and Chat between 10:50 PT to 11:28 PT. Consumer users were not affected.\n- Calendar, Tasks, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, Keep, Jamboard, Chat: Affected users experienced HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors.\n- Admin Console: Customers' admin consoles displayed generic logos, rather than company specific logos.\n- Groups: Groups User Interface and Settings API served HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors to all users.\nGoogle Cloud Product Impact :\nA small number of users of the following GCP may have experienced increased error rates and unavailability between 10:50 PT to 11:38 PT in the following regions.\n- Google Compute Engine: Affected customers experienced elevated API traffic error rates up to 6% in the following regions: asia-east2, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-northeast 1, asia-south1, asia-south2, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, europe-west9, and southamerica-east1.\n- Google Cloud Console: Approximately 3% of customers were affected, experiencing increased error rates of up to 0.5%.\n- Resource Manager: Affected customers may have seen elevated error rates up to 2.6% and seen generic status unavailable errors when using the API.\n- Google BigQuery: Affected customers experienced elevated API traffic error rates up to 10% when using the - BigQuery storage read and write APIs in southamerica-west1 and in the BigQuery US multi-region.\n- Cloud Firestore: Up to 7.5% of customer projects experienced elevated latency, operation deadline expirations, and/or error messages that state Policy Checks are unavailable. The impact was restricted to projects hosted in nam5 US multi-region, which includes us-central1.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Global","id":"global"}]},"status_impact":"SERVICE_OUTAGE","severity":"high","service_key":"zall","service_name":"Multiple

at 00:04 PST customers of Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Google BigQuery may have seen intermittent error messages while using these services in europe-west1 for a duration of 8 hours and 3 minutes.\nTo our GCS and BigQuery customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nThis issue was caused by a recent rollout that was intended to improve maintenance, efficiency, and supportability by sharing internal data requests to new jobs. However, due to an issue in the rollout, the migration of the data resulted in transient faults and caused a failure rate of up to 7% of read and 19% of write traffic in europe-west1.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle Engineers were alerted to this issue and immediately started to investigate the issue.\nEngineers identified the problematic rollout above; however, the first two attempts to roll back this change were not effective to resolve the issue. Google engineers then identified a quicker and more effective, direct mitigation. This change took a couple of minutes to complete and fully mitigated the impact.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is taking the following actions:\n- We have postponed the internal data migration rollout until all critical preventative action measures are resolved.\n- Going forward, we will pause binary rollouts and stop retry updates after Google engineers get alerted to paging events.\n- We will implement a two-stage canary deployment for rollouts to reduce the percentage of impacted tasks due to catastrophic error.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Thursday, 10 November 2022 from 00:04 US/Pacific to 08:07 US/Pacific, 7% of read and 19% of write traffic in europe-west1 region was failing. All of the impact was limited to data operations, including read, write, rewrite, clone, compose, and upload of objects. Customers in the europe-west1 region may have experienced the following symptoms during this period:\n- Affected GCS customers may have received HTTP 503 errors for read/write operations in europe-west1. Metadata operations such as object listing continued to work successfully.\n- Affected customers of Google BigQuery may have received “INTERNAL_ERROR” when running import jobs in europe-west1 during the impact window.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Belgium (europe-west1)","id":"europe-west1"}]},{"created":"2022-11-10T22:42:40+00:00","modified":"2022-11-10T22:42:40+00:00","when":"2022-11-10T22:42:40+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption may have caused.

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 24 October 2022 03:00\n**Incident End:** 02 November 2022 20:00\n**Duration:** 9 days, 17 hours\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nVirtual Private Cloud\n**Regions/Zones:** global\n**Description:**\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC) experienced connectivity issues between instances and/or with on-premises machines. In some cases, data plane components in affected regions did not get dynamic routes from peered networks.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a rollout to virtual network controllers. The rollout started on 24 October 2022 to a small subset of controllers and gradually scaled over time to other controllers.\nThe issue was mitigated on 02 November 2022 by rolling back.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers were unable to access their Cloud Volume Service (CVS) storage across GCP Regions.\nCustomers may have faced issues with traffic routing In some cases where dynamic routes were not propagated appropriately on peered networks across regions.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong

In some cases, data plane components in affected regions did not get dynamic routes from peered networks.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a rollout to virtual network controllers. The rollout started on 24 October 2022 to a small subset of controllers and gradually scaled over time to other controllers.\nThe issue was mitigated on 02 November 2022 by rolling back.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers were unable to access their Cloud Volume Service (CVS) storage across GCP Regions.\nCustomers may have faced issues with traffic routing In some cases where dynamic routes were not propagated appropriately on peered networks across regions.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Taiwan (asia-east1)","id":"asia-east1"},{"title":"Hong Kong

The issue was mitigated by appropriately increasing resources and manually restarting old tasks, which were overloaded with pending connections.\nFrom preliminary analysis, an increase in calls to the Write API, a unified data-ingestion API in BigQuery [1], caused frontend resources to be overloaded. A suboptimal distribution of the load resulted in an elevated error rate. Google engineering is continuing to investigate the matter, and we will publish a final root cause analysis on the Google Cloud Service Health Dashboard as part of a formal Incident Report.\n**Customer Impact:**\nDuring this period of time:\nCustomers making calls using Write API in the US region observed increased levels of connection failures.\nCustomers making calls using InsertAll API in the US region may also have observed a slight increase in failures due to subsequent increase in traffic.\n**Reference(s):**\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-api","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"}]},{"created":"2022-10-14T11:51:24+00:00","modified":"2022-10-14T11:51:30+00:00","when":"2022-10-14T11:51:24+00:00","text":"The issue with Google BigQuery has been resolved for all affected users as of Friday, 2022-10-14 04:50 US/Pacific.\nWe thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the issue.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Multi-region: us","id":"us"},{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"}]},{"created":"2022-10-14T11:41:11+00:00","modified":"2022-10-14T11:41:17+00:00","when":"2022-10-14T11:41:11+00:00","text":"Summary: BigQuery is experiencing issues with streaming API in US region\nDescription: We are experiencing an issue with Google BigQuery.\nOur engineering team continues to investigate the issue.\nWe will provide an update by Friday, 2022-10-14 05:10 US/Pacific with current details.\nWe apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.\nDiagnosis: Customers making calls to streaming API in the US region may see raised levels of errors.\nWorkaround: None.","status":"SERVICE_DISRUPTION","affected_locations":[{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"}]}],"most_recent_update":{"created":"2022-10-31T18:56:14+00:00","modified":"2022-10-31T18:56:14+00:00","when":"2022-10-31T18:56:14+00:00","text":"# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 13 October 2022, BigQuery Storage WriteAPI observed elevated error rates in the US Multi-Region for a period of 5 hours.

2022, Google Cloud experienced a traffic disruption in the wide-area network connecting the us-east1 and us-central1 cloud regions. Inter-region traffic in Google Cloud, and Internet-to-Google Cloud traffic, may have been disrupted if it transited this network path. We are aware of potential impact in several Cloud regions including asia-east1, asia-northeast1, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-west1, europe-west2, europe-west3, europe-west4, northamerica-northeast1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2, us-west4, as well as to Google Workspace, with a total duration of 22 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nThe traffic disruption in Google's wide-area network was triggered by brief failures in fiber-optic cables, in the presence of a pre-existing failure nearby in the network.\nThese brief failures occurred progressively across a 18-minute period on Friday, 22 September 2022, from 04:28 to 04:46 US/Pacific. Each event required a rerouting of traffic, extending the impact to 04:50.\nThe pre-existing failure occurred on Wednesday, 20 September 2022 22:10 US/Pacific, and was still under repair at the time of the second failure on Friday 22nd September.\nGoogle's interregional backbone is designed with multiple levels of redundancy and is provisioned to reroute Cloud traffic with minimal disruption under all common failure scenarios. In this case, the backbone was designed with appropriate redundancy to survive this dual-failure scenario, but traffic in the affected regions experienced longer rerouting delays. Traffic flowing over other network links experienced disruption as rerouted traffic sought alternate, less congested backup paths.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle's network reacted automatically to the 04:28 to 04:46 events, rerouting within our design goals and fully recovered by 04:50.\nOur network controls software automatically removed the impacted links from service for our engineers to investigate, since unreliable paths cause more short-term impact than failed paths. There was no shortage of capacity at any time; all disruptions were caused by rerouting.\nThe probability and impact of these scenarios is exhaustively modeled to ensure such double\nfailures occur very infrequently and do not exceed long-term (yearly \u0026 multi-year) availability targets.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Verify fiber-optic cable maintenance procedures adequately manage the risk of physical interruption during repair and other maintenance activity, including hitless proactive traffic moves where appropriate.\n- Ensuring capacity modeling software is correctly assessing the risk of dual failures, and allowing more headroom for rerouted traffic where those failures are more likely.\n- Ensuring automatic removal of unreliable capacity is acting aggressively enough to avoid areas with progressive failures.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 22 September 2022, between 04:28 to 04:50 US/Pacific unless otherwise noted the following services (but not limited to) may have been impacted for various customers in the following cloud regions: asia-east1, asia-northeast1, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-west1, europe-west2, europe-west3, europe-west4, northamerica-northeast1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2, us-west4, unless otherwise noted.\n### Google Compute Engine\nAffected Google Compute Engine customers may have experienced increased latency and packet loss between Compute Engine instances in affected regions.\n### Google Cloud BigTable\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 04:29 through 04:51 in asia-east1, us-central1, us-south1, us-west1, and us-west4.\n### Google Chat\nAffected Google Chat customers would have experienced errors when accessing, creating, or responding to chats from 04:28 through 04:51.\n### Google Voice\nGoogle Voice users might have experienced some of their actions failing during the impact window due to an internal error. This includes all actions such as sending SMS, placing \u0026 receiving calls, loading call history, etc. Affected web, Android, and iOS users.\n### Google Cloud Storage\nA small percentage of Google Cloud Storage customers may have experienced errors in requests to GCS buckets in asia-south2, asia-southeast2, us-west1 and us-west2.\n### Google Cloud Load Balancing\nAffected Google Cloud Load Balancing customers may have experienced increased HTTP 5XX errors. Globally around 3M queries were served with 5XX response during the two outage windows and us-west1, asia-east1, asia-south1, asia-south2 and asia-southeast1 saw the most of the failing queries.","status":"AVAILABLE","affected_locations":[{"title":"Iowa (us-central1)","id":"us-central1"},{"title":"South Carolina (us-east1)","id":"us-east1"},{"title":"Oregon (us-west1)","id":"us-west1"}]},{"created":"2022-09-22T21:22:31+00:00","modified":"2022-10-03T19:35:56+00:00","when":"2022-09-22T21:22:31+00:00","text":"# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused.
